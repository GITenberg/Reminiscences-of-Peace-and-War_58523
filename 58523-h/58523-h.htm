<h2>
Preface
</h2>

<p>
It will be obvious to the reader that this book
affects neither the "dignity of history" nor the
authority of political instruction. The causes which
precipitated the conflict between the sections and
the momentous events which attended the struggle
have been recounted by writers competent to the
task. But descriptions of battles and civil convulsions
do not exhibit the full condition of the South
in the crisis. To complete the picture, social characteristics
and incidents of private life are indispensable
lineaments. It occurs to the author that
a plain and unambitious narrative of her recollections
of Washington society during the calm which
preceded the storm, and of Virginia under the
afflictions and sorrows of the fratricidal strife, will
not be without interest in the retrospect of that
memorable era. The present volume recalls that
era in the aspect in which it appeared to a woman
rather than as it appeared to a statesman or a
philosopher.

Reminiscences of Peace and

<h2>
CHAPTER I
<br />
<span class="s05">WASHINGTON IN THE FIFTIES</span>
</h2>

<p>
The Washington that I knew in the fifties
was not the Washington of Dickens, Mrs.
Trollope, and Laurence Oliphant. When I
knew the capital of our country, it was not "a howling
wilderness of deserted streets running out into
the country and ending nowhere, its population consisting
chiefly of politicians and negroes";<a name='FA_1' id='FA_1' href='#FN_1' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> nor were
the streets overrun with pigs and infested with goats.
I never saw these animals in the streets of Washington;
but a story, told to illustrate the best way
of disposing of the horns of a dilemma proves one
goat at least to have had the freedom of the city.
It seems that Henry Clay, overdue at the Senate
Chamber, was once hurrying along Pennsylvania
Avenue when he was attacked by a large goat. Mr.
Clay seized his adversary by the horns. So far so
good, but how about the next step? A crowd
of sympathetic bootblacks and newsboys gathered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4' href='#Page_4'>4</a></span>
around offering advice. "Let go, Mr. Clay, and
run like blazes," shouted one; and Mr. Clay did
let go and did run, his senatorial coat-tails flying
like pennons behind him.
</p>

<p>
But this was before my day. I remember Washington
only as a garden of delights, over which the
spring trailed an early robe of green, thickly embroidered
with gems of amethyst and ruby, pearl and
sapphire. The crocuses, hyacinths, tulips, and snowdrops
made haste to bloom before the snows had
fairly melted. The trees donned their diaphanous
veils of green earlier in the White House grounds,
the lawn of the Smithsonian Institution, and the
gentle slopes around the Capitol, than anywhere in
less distinguished localities. To walk through these
incense-laden grounds, to traverse the avenue of
blossoming crab-apples, was pure pleasure. The
shaded avenues were delightful long lanes, where
one was sure to meet friends, and where no law of
etiquette forbade a pause in the public street for a
few words of kindly inquiry, or a bit of gossip, or
the development of some plan for future meetings.
If one's steps tended to the neighborhood of 7th and
D streets, nothing was more probable than a meeting
with one of Washington's most noted citizens,â€”the
superb mastiff of Mr. Gales, the veteran editor
of the <i>National Intelligencer</i>, as the dog gravely bore
in a large basket the mail for the office. No attendant
was needed by this fine animal. He was fully competent
to protect his master's private and official
correspondence.
</p>

<p>
He had been taught to express stern disapprobation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5' href='#Page_5'>5</a></span>
of Democrats; so if a pleasant walk with him
was desired, it was expedient for members of that
party to perjure themselves and at once announce:
"I am an 'Old-Line Whig,' old man," and the dog's
tail would wag a cordial welcome.
</p>

<p>
Omnibuses ran along Pennsylvania Avenue, for
the convenience of Senators, Congressmen, and others
on their way to the Capitol,â€”but the saunter along
the avenue was so charming that I always preferred
it to the People's Line. There were few shops. But
such shops! There was Galt's, where the silver,
gems, and marbles were less attractive than the cultivated
gentleman who sold them; Gautier's, the palace
of sweets, with Mrs. Gautier in an arm-chair
before her counter to tell you the precise social
status of every one of her customers, and what is
more, to put you in your own; Harper's, where the
dainty, leisurely salesman treated his laces with respect,
drawing up his cuffs lest they touch the ethereal
beauties; and the little corner shop of stern
Madame Delarue, who imported as many (and no
more) hats and gloves as she was willing to sell as a
favor to the ladies of the diplomatic and official
circles, and whose dark-eyed daughter LÃ©onide
(named for her godmother, a Greek lady of rank)
was susceptible of unreasoning friendships and could
be coaxed to preserve certain treasures for humbler
folk.
</p>

<p>
LÃ©onide once awoke me in the middle of the
night with a note bidding me "come <i><span lang="fr_FR">tout de suite</span></i>,"
for "Maman" was asleep, the boxes had arrived;
and she and I could peep at the bonnets and choose
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6' href='#Page_6'>6</a></span>
the best one for myself. Thus it was that I once
bore away a "divine creation" of point lace, crÃªpe,
and shaded asters before Madame had seen it.
Otherwise it would have been reserved for Miss
Harriet Lane or Mrs. Douglas. Madame had to
know later; and LÃ©onide was not much in evidence
the rest of that season. At Madame Delarue's, if one
was very <i><span lang="fr_FR">gentil</span></i>, very <i><span lang="fr_FR">convenable</span></i>, one might have the
services of FranÃ§ois, the one and only hair-dresser of
note, who had adjusted coronets on noble heads,
and who could (if he so minded) talk of them agreeably
in Parisian French.
</p>

<p>
All these were little things; but do not pleasant
trifles make the sum of pleasant hours? Washington
was like a great village in those days of President
Pierce and President Buchanan. To obtain
the best of the few articles to be purchased was an
achievement.
</p>

<p>
My own pride in the Federal City was such that
my heart would swell within me at every glimpse of
the Capitol: from the moment it rose like a white
cloud above the smoke and mists, as I stood on the
deck of the steamboat (having run up from my dinner
to salute Mount Vernon), to the time when I
was wont to watch from my window for the sunset,
that I might catch the moment when a point on the
unfinished dome glowed like a great blazing star
after the sun had really gone down. No matter
whether suns rose or set, there was the star of our
country,â€”the star of our hearts and hopes.
</p>

<p>
I acknowledge that Wisdom is much to be desired
of her children, but nowhere is it promised
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7' href='#Page_7'>7</a></span>
that they will be the happier for gaining her. When
my lot was cast in Washington, Wisdom had not
taught me that the White House was less beautiful
than a classic temple. To be sure, Dickens had
called it "like an English club-house,"â€”that was
bad enough,â€”but Mark Twain had not yet dubbed
it "a fine, large, white barn with wide handsome
grounds around it." "The President lives there,"
says Washington Hawkins. "It is ugly enough
outside, but that is nothing to what it is inside."
To my uneducated eye the East Room with its
ornate chandeliers, fluted pillars, and floriated carpet
was an audience chamber fit for a king. A triumph
of artistic perfection was the equestrian statue of
the hero of New Orleans, now known to be out of
all proportion, and condemned as "bad" and "very
bad" by Wisdom's instructed children. Raising
his hat, indeed! Why, any man in that position
would be holding on to the mane with both hands
to keep from sliding off. And as for the Capitolâ€”the
sacred Capitol! From foundation to turret it
was to my eye all that genius and patriotism could
achieve. The splendid marbles at the entrance, the
paintings, the bas-reliefs within the rotunda,â€”these
were things to boast of, to dream of. Not yet had
arisen our irreverent humorist to warn us never to
enter the dome of the Capitol, "because to get
there you must pass through the great rotunda, and
to do that you would have to see the marvellous historical
paintings that hang there and the bas-reliefs,â€”and
what have you done that you should suffer
this?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8' href='#Page_8'>8</a></span>
</p>

<p>
When our friends came up from Virginia to make
us visits, it was delightful to take a carriage and
give up days to sight-seeing; to visit the White
House and Capitol, the Patent Office with its miscellaneous
treasures; to point with pride to the rich
gifts from crowned heads which our adored first
President was too conscientious to accept; to walk
among the stones lying around the base of the unfinished
monument and read the inscriptions from
the states presenting them; to spend a day at the
Smithsonian Institution, and to introduce our friends
to its president, Mr. Henry; and to Mr. Spencer
Baird and Mr. Gerard, eminent naturalists, who
were giving their lives to the study of birds, beasts,
and fishes,â€”finding them, Mr. Gerard said, "so
much more interesting than men," adding hastily,
"we do not say ladies," and blushing after the manner
of cloistered scholars; to tell them interesting
things about Mr. Gerard who was a melancholy
young man, and who had confided to me that he
had sustained a great sorrow. Had he lost his
fortune, or been crossed in love, was he homesick
for his native Switzerland? Worse than any one or
all of these! He had been sent once to Nantucket
in the interests of his profession. There he had
found a strange fish, hitherto unknown to science.
He had classified its bones and laid them out on his
table to count them. In a moment's absence the
housemaid had entered and dusted his table.
</p>

<p>
Then the visits to the galleries of the House and
Senate Chamber, and the honor of pointing out the
great men to our friends from rural districts; the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9' href='#Page_9'>9</a></span>
long listening to interminable speeches, not clearly
understood, but heard with a reverent conviction
that all was coming out right in the end, that everybody
was really working for the good of his country,
and that we belonged to it all and were parts of
it all.
</p>

<p>
This was the thought behind all other thoughts
which glorified everything around us, enhanced every
fortunate circumstance, and caused us to ignore the
real discomforts of life in Washington: the cold,
the ice-laden streets in winter; the whirlwinds of
dust and driving rains of spring; the swift-coming
fierceness of summer heat; the rapid atmospheric
changes which would give us all these extremes
in one week, or even one day, until it became
the part of prudence never to sally forth on any
expedition without "a fan, an overcoat, and an
umbrella."
</p>

<p>
The social life in Washington was almost as variable
as the climate. At the end of every four
years the kaleidoscope turned, and lo!â€”a new
central jewel and new colors and combinations in
the setting.
</p>

<p>
But behind this "floating population," as the political
circles were termed, there was a fine society in
the fifties of "old residents" who never bent the knee
to Baal. This society was sufficient to itself, never
seeking the new, while accepting it occasionally with
discretion, reservations, and much discriminating care.
The sisters, Mrs. Gales and Mrs. Seaton, wives of
the editors of the <i>National Intelligencer</i>, led this
society. Mrs. Gales's home was outside the city,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10' href='#Page_10'>10</a></span>
and thence every day Mr. Gales was driven in his
barouche to his office. His paper was the exponent
of the Old-Line Whigs (the Republican party was
formed later) and in stern opposition to the Democrats.
It was, therefore, a special and unexpected
honor for a Democrat to be permitted to drive out
to "the cottage" for a glass of wine and a bit of
fruit-cake with Mrs. Gales and Mrs. Seaton. Never
have I seen these gentlewomen excelled in genial
hospitality. Mrs. Gales was a superb old lady and
a fine conversationalist. She had the courteous repose
born of dignity and intelligence. She was literally
her husband's right hand,â€”he had lost his own,â€”and
was the only person who could decipher his
left-hand writing. So that when anything appeared
from his pen it had been copied by his wife before
it reached the type-setter. A fine education this for
an intelligent woman; the very best schooling for a
social life including diplomats from foreign countries,
politicians of diverse opinions, artists, authors,
musicians, women of fashion, to entertain whom
required infinite tact, cleverness, and an intimate
acquaintance with the absorbing questions of the
day.
</p>

<p>
Of course the levees and state receptions, which
were accessible to all, required none of these things.
The role of hostess on state occasions could be
filled creditably by any woman of ordinary physical
strength, patience, and self-control, who knew when
to be silent.
</p>

<p>
Washington society, at the time of which I write,
was comparatively free from non-official men of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11' href='#Page_11'>11</a></span>
wealth from other cities who, weary with the monotonous
round of travel,â€”to the Riviera, to Egypt,
to Monte Carlo,â€”are attracted by the unique atmosphere
of a city holding many foreigners, and devoted
not to commercial but to social and political interests.
The doors of the White House and Cabinet
offices being open on occasions to all, they have
opportunities denied them in their own homes.
Society in Washington in the fifties was peculiarly
interesting in that it was composed exclusively of
men whose presence argued them to have been of importance
at home. They had been elected by the
people, or chosen by the President, or selected
among the very best in foreign countries; or they
belonged to the United States Army or Navy service,
or to the descendants of the select society which
had gathered in the city early in its history.
</p>

<p>
During the Fillmore administration there were
peculiar elements in Washington society. The
President was born of poor English parents. At
the age of fifteen he was apprentice to a wool-carder
in Livingston County, New York, representing in
his father's mind no higher hope than gradual advancement
until he should attain the proud place of
woollen-draper. But at nineteen he had entered a
lawyer's office, working all day, teaching and studying
at night. When he became President his tastes
had been sufficiently ripened to enable him to gather
around him men of literary taste and attainment.
John P. Kennedy, an author and a man of elegant
accomplishments, was Secretary of the Navy.
Washington Irving was Kennedy's friend, and often
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12' href='#Page_12'>12</a></span>
his guest. Lesser lights in the world of letters found
Washington an agreeable residence. We knew many
of these men, and among them none was brighter,
wittier, or more genial than G. P. R. James, the
English novelist whose star rose and set before 1860.
He was the most prolific of writers, "Like an endless
chain of buckets in a well," said one; "as fast
as one is emptied up comes another."
</p>

<p>
We were very fond of Mr. James. One day he
dashed in, much excited:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen the <i>Intelligencer</i>? By George,
it's all true! Six times has my hero, a 'solitary
horseman,' emerged from a wood! My word!
I was totally unconscious of it! Fancy it! Six
times! Well, it's all up with that fellow. He has
got to dismount and enter on foot: a beggar, or
burglar, or pedler, or at best a mendicant friar."
</p>

<p>
"But," suggested one, "he might drive, mightn't
he?"
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!" said Mr. James. "Imagine a
hero in a gig or a curricle!"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," said one, "the word 'solitary' has
given offence. Americans dislike exclusiveness.
They are sensitive, you see, and look out for
snobs."
</p>

<p>
He made himself very merry over it; but the solitary
horseman appeared no more in the few novels
he was yet to write.
</p>

<p>
One day, after a pleasant visit from Mr. James
and his wife, I accompanied them at parting to the
front door, and found some difficulty in turning the
bolt. He offered to assist, but I said noâ€”he was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13' href='#Page_13'>13</a></span>
not supposed to understand the mystery of an
American front door.
</p>

<p>
Having occasion a few minutes afterward to open
the door for another departing guest, there on his
knees outside was Mr. James, who laughingly explained
that he had left his wife at the corner, and
had come back to investigate that mystery. "Perhaps
you will tell me," he added, and was much
amused to learn that the American door opened of
itself to an incoming guest, but positively refused
without coaxing to let him out. "By George, that's
fine!" he said, "that'll please the critics in my
next." I never knew whether it was admitted, for
I must confess that, even with the stimulus of his
presence, his books were dreary reading to my uninstructed
taste.
</p>

<p>
A very lovely and charming actress was prominent
in Washington society at this time,â€”the
daughter of an old New York family, Anna Cora
(Ogden) Mowatt. She was especially interesting to
Virginians, for she had captivated Foushee Ritchie,
soon afterward my husband's partner on the editorship
of the <i>Richmond Enquirer</i>. Mr. Ritchie, a confirmed
old bachelor, had been fascinated by Mrs.
Mowatt's Parthenia (in "Ingomar") and was now
engaged to her. He proudly brought to me a pair
of velvet slippers she had embroidered for him,
working around them as a border a quotation from
"Ingomar":â€”
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Two souls with but a single thought,</p>
<p>Two hearts that beat as one."</p>
</div></div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14' href='#Page_14'>14</a></span>
</p>

<p class="post">
And oh, <i>how</i> angry he was when an irreverent voice
whispered one word, "Soles!"
</p>

<p>
"Cora must never hear of this," he declared indignantly;
"she is, beyond all women, incapable of
<i><span lang="fr_FR">double entendre</span></i>, of coarse allusion."
</p>

<p>
Alas! I cannot conclude my little story, "And
they were married and lived happily ever after."
They were marriedâ€”and lived miserablyâ€”and
were separated ever after. The single thought was
how they could best escape each otherâ€”and the
two hearts beat as one in the desire for freedom.
</p>

<p>
"The shadow of the coming war was even then
beginning to darken the land and confuse legislation
with bitter partisanship and continuous attempts at
an impossible compromise," but, alas! our eyes
were holden so we could not see.

<h2>
CHAPTER II
<br />
<span class="s05">PRESIDENT PIERCE'S INAUGURATION</span>
</h2>

<p>
On the 4th of March, 1853, Franklin Pierce
was inaugurated President of the United
States. This was an exciting day for me.
My husband had written articles for a Virginia paper
which had won for him a place on the editorial staff
of the <i>Washington Union</i>, and was now in a position
to break a lance with my friends, Messrs. Gales and
Seaton. Mr. Pierce had liked his articles in the
<i>Union</i>, and sought his acquaintance. A friendship
rapidly followed which was a happiness to us both.
So when some member of the staff of the Democratic
organ must be consulted about the inaugural
address, the President had sent for my young husband
and had taken counsel with him.
</p>

<p>
I was delighted when I received an invitation
from my good friends of the Smithsonian Institution
to join them in a pleasant room opening on a balcony
and overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue, where
we were to have a collation and witness the parade.
My husband's sixteen-year-old sister, Fanny, was
with me, and she was literally wild with delight.
The rest of the party were Mr. and Mrs. Spencer
Baird, little Lucy Baird, Mr. Gerard, and Mr.
Turner. Little eight-year-old Lucy was the belle
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16' href='#Page_16'>16</a></span>
of the occasion; so wise in scientific matters, knowing
so much about "specimens" and "extinct
species" that we felt ourselves heavy and ignorant
beside her. "Come now, Lucy," said Mr. Turner,
"I expect you to take care of me on this occasion.
These are painful scenes for an Englishman. When
you see the Continental troops coming, give me the
wink, and I'll slip away and stir the punch. Those
are the fellows who whipped the British!"
</p>

<p>
The elements frowned upon the change of administration.
The sun was blanketed with dark
clouds, from which the snow fell thicklyâ€”not a
soft, enfolding snow, but snow driven by an angry
wind. The crowd in the avenue was immense;
swelled by the presence of the largest number of
strangers ever before gathered at an Inauguration,
the majority of whom were members of the mighty
army of office-seekers from the party recently come
into power. From the White House to the Capitol,
windows, balconies, and roofs were thronged; and
the sidewalks of the avenue were filled with a motley
crowd of men, women, and children, foreigners, government
clerks, and negroes.
</p>

<p>
About twelve o'clock the boom of a great gun
announced the moving of the procession. The
throng in the streets surged toward the gates of the
Capitol, and "lined up" on either side awaiting
the arrival of the cortÃ¨ge. Carriages filled with
women and children, some of them with the emblazoned
panels of foreign ministers, passed rapidly
in advance of the cavalcadeâ€”the police actively
engaged the while in keeping the waiting crowd
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17' href='#Page_17'>17</a></span>
within bounds. Presently distant music was heard,
and a mighty cheer announced the near approach of
the escort. Six marshals in gay scarfs led the procession.
Then came the "flying artillery," drawn
by fifty or more horses. An interval, and then platoons
of soldiers of diverse battalions filled square
after square, and band after band of martial music
mingled with the cheers of the crowd.
</p>

<p>
We were all out now on the balcony, little Lucy
keenly alert. Presently she touched Mr. Turner
on his arm and he fled! The Continentals were
passing.
</p>

<p>
Following these, in an open carriage drawn by
four fine horses, came our President: the youngest,
handsomest President we had ever elected. As he
neared our balcony we stood up, waved and cheered,
and threw him flowers, and so winning in their
enthusiasm were little Lucy (her mind being now
quite at rest about Mr. Turner) and my own young
sister, that the President rose and bared his head to
us.
</p>

<p>
A platform had been erected over the steps of the
east wing, and on it was a table holding a Bible.
The distinguished officials of the time were seated
around this table, and beneath it the crowd pushed
and scrambled and struggled for place within hearing.
Instantly there was silence. The slender,
almost boyish figure of our President approached
the table, and with bared head under the falling
snow stood for a moment surveying the crowd.
</p>

<p>
His face was pale, and his countenance wore an
expression of weary sadness. When he took the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18' href='#Page_18'>18</a></span>
oath he did not, as is the custom, use the word
"swear." Placing his left hand on the Bible without
raising the book, he raised his right and, looking
upward, "affirmed" that, God helping him, he
would be faithful to his trust.
</p>

<p>
There were tears in his voice, but it was musical,
and his enunciation was clear and distinct.
</p>

<p>
Only two months before, his only child, a beautiful
boy of thirteen, had been killed in a railroad
collisionâ€”killed before his parents' eyes! His
address began, "My countrymen! It is a relief to
feel that no heart but my own can know the personal
regret and bitter sorrow over which I have
been borne to a position so suitable for others
rather than desirable for myself."
</p>

<p>
The public does not tolerate the intrusion of a
man's personal joys and griefs into his official life.
However willing the world may be to sympathize,
it considers this indicative of a mind lacking fineness
and delicacy. To keep one's inner self in the
background should be the instinct, and is surely
the policy, of every man and woman who aspires to
popularity.
</p>

<p>
There were many who quickly criticised this unfortunate
sentence of the President. The Whig
journals sneered at it as "a trick of the orator to
awaken personal interest before proceeding to unfold
his public policy." But he had the sympathetic
tears of many of his audience.
</p>

<p>
His address went on to discuss the annexation of
Cubaâ€”a dream which lasted through many subsequent
years. The Pearl of the Antilles was ardently
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19' href='#Page_19'>19</a></span>
coveted as a pendant to our chain of states, but she
will never belong to us, unless as the result of more
misfortune. The President then pledged himself to
the never dying Monroe Doctrine, prayed appealingly
for the preservation of our Union, and
touched upon the troubled questions which, despite
all our wars and sufferings, are not yet fully settled.
And then, amid cheers and shouts and salvos of
artillery, he was driven to his new home, and it was
all over.
</p>

<p>
Three days after the inauguration the Cabinet
nominations were sent to the Senate. Mr. Marcy
was to be Secretary of State; Mr. Guthrie, Secretary
of the Treasury; Jefferson Davis, of War;
James Dobbin, of the Navy; Robert McClelland,
of the Interior; James Campbell, Postmaster-General;
Caleb Cushing, Attorney-Generalâ€”four men
from the North, three from the South. These,
then, with their families, were to lead the social life
of Washington for four years. The Executive
Mansion, shrouded in gloom, could never become a
social centre.
</p>

<p>
We had the honor of knowing well the three
most distinguished of these men, Mr. Marcy, Mr.
Davis, and Mr. Cushing.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Marcy, the best-known member of the Cabinet,
strong, honest, and an adroit politician, was a
man of rugged and abrupt manners, yet a great favorite
with the ladies. We at once became keenly
interested in his initial proceedings. He was sternly
democratic in his ideas. Absorbing as were the
cares of his department, exciting and menacing as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20' href='#Page_20'>20</a></span>
were the questions of the hour, he inaugurated his
official life by settling matters of dress and etiquetteâ€”so
far as they related to the presence of American
envoys at foreign courts. President Jackson
had been supposed to be democratic, but he was a
bloated aristocrat beside Mr. Marcy. Jackson had
rejected the prescribed court dress,â€”embroidered
cuffs and cape, white breeches, gold knee-buckles,
white silk stockings, gold shoe-buckles, chapeau-bras,
cockade, eagle, white feather, and sword.
Alackaday, that we should have lost all this
bravery! Jackson decreed no cape at all (such a
friendly fashion to laden shoulders), no embroidery
except a gold star on the coat-collar,â€”but
breeches and modest buckles, a sword, a chapeau-bras
with eagle and cockade.
</p>

<p>
Now why should Mr. Marcy make trouble by
meddling with the cut of the garments of our representatives
abroadâ€”at a time, too, when such a
number of serious questions were about to come
before him; when filibusters were at work, a war
with Spain imminent, treaties to be made with
Mexico, and fishery questions to be settled with
England? Simply, I suppose, because great men
all over the world have condescended to prescribe
in trifling mattersâ€”matters belonging to the chef,
the milliner, the arbiter of fleeting fashions. It
would seem that the greater the man the greater
his appreciation of trifles. Everything to him is
importantâ€”from the signing of a treaty to the
tying of a shoestring.
</p>

<p>
The consequences of Mr. Marcy's meddling were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21' href='#Page_21'>21</a></span>
far-reaching. On June 1, 1853, he issued a circular
recommending that our representatives abroad
should, in order to show their devotion to republican
institutions, appear whenever practicable in the
simple dress of an American citizen.
</p>

<p>
Our Minister at Berne found the court of Switzerland
quite willing to receive him in his citizen's
dress. The Ministers at Turin and Brussels reported
they would have no difficulty in carrying out the instructions
of the State Department. The representative
at Berlin was at once informed that such action
would be considered disrespectful. The king of
Sweden insisted on court dress at social functions.
Mr. August Belmont, at The Hague, received a cold
permission from the king to dress as he pleasedâ€”and
it is recorded (as matter for gratitude on the
part of the American Minister) that after all, and
notwithstanding, the queen actually danced with
him in his citizen's dress, and the king condescended
to shake him by the hand and to talk with
him!
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mason, at the French court, could not face
the music! He consulted his wife, and together
they agreed upon a compromise. He appeared in
an embroidered coat, sword, and cocked hat, and
had the misfortune to receive from Mr. Marcy a
severe rebuke.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Buchanan, at the court of St. James, having
no wife to consult, thought long and anxiously on
the subject. The question was still unsettled at the
opening of Parliament in February, 1854. Our
Minister did not attend,â€”he had "nothing to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22' href='#Page_22'>22</a></span>
wear,"â€”whereupon "there was quite a sensation
in the House of Lords." "Indeed," he wrote to
Mr. Marcy, "I have found difficulty in preventing
this incident from becoming a subject of inquiry
and remark in the House of Commons." Think
of that! At a time when England was on the eve
of a war with Russia, all the newspapers, court officials,
House of Commons, exercised about the dress
of the American Minister! The <i>London Times</i>
stated that on a diplomatic occasion "the American
Minister sate unpleasantly conscious of his singularity."
The <i>London Chronicle</i> blamed General
Pierce's republican ill manners, and the "American
puppyism," and continued: "There is not the least
reason why her Majesty should be troubled to
receive the 'gentleman in the black coat' from
Yankee-land! He can say his say at the Foreign
Office, dine at a chop-house in King Street, sleep at
the old Hummums, and be off as he came, per liner,
when his business is done."
</p>

<p>
Poor Mr. Buchanan, sorely pressed, conceived
the idea of costuming himself like General Washington,
and to that end examined Stuart's portrait.
He may even have gone so far as to indulge in a
private rehearsalâ€”<i><span lang="fr_FR">queue</span></i>, powdered wig, and all;
but he seems to have perceived he would only
make himself ridiculous; so he took his life in his
hands andâ€”brave gentleman as he wasâ€”appeared
at the queen's levee in the dress of an American
citizen; and she, true lady as she was, settled the
matter, for her court at least, by receiving him as
she did all others. Mr. Buchanan wrote to his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23' href='#Page_23'>23</a></span>
niece, Miss Harriet Lane, "I wore a sword to
gratify those who yielded so much, and to distinguish
me from the upper court servants."
</p>

<p>
Mr. SoulÃ©, at the court of Madrid, adopted the
costume of Benjamin Franklin at the court of
Louis XVIâ€”sword, chapeau, black velvet, and
much embroidery, looking, "with his black eyes,
black looks, and pale complexion, less like the
philosopher whose costume he imitated than the
master of Ravenswood." There had been a lively
discussion among the Austrian and Mexican Ministers
and the Countess of Montijo, the mother of
the Empress EugÃ©nie and of the Duchess of Alba,
whether or no he should be rejected; but Mr.
SoulÃ© did not know this. The queen received him,
he wrote to Mr. Marcy, "with marked attention
and courtesy."
</p>

<p>
There is no telling whether this simple deviation
from the prescribed court dress was not the real
cause of Mr. SoulÃ©'s serious troubles at court. It
was the Duke of Alba who provided the spark
which fired the train of Spanish indignation against
him and occasioned a quarrel which resulted in two
duels and strained relations which were never
reconciled.
</p>

<p>
It is always dangerous to infringe upon accepted
rules of etiquette, even in association with those
who are themselves defiant of these rules. I discovered
that Mr. Marcy was very jealous of respect
due to himself, as well as to his government.
</p>

<p>
He was a prime favorite, as I have said, with
the ladiesâ€”and with none more than the charming
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24' href='#Page_24'>24</a></span>
family of "Father Ritchie," as we called one of
Washington's most esteemed citizens. Mr. Ritchie
had been editor for forty years of the <i>Richmond
Enquirer</i>, which he had founded under the auspices
of Thomas Jefferson, and made one of the most
influential Democratic papers of the country. His
home in Washington was noted for elegant hospitality.
He lived next door to Mr. Corcoran on
Lafayette Square, near St. John's Church. He had
lovely daughters, and whenever Mr. Marcy appeared
in the salons of the town, one or more of these
ladies was sure to be with him.
</p>

<p>
It so happened that some of us were much interested
in a poor, worthy young man, who desired
a position in the State Department. His application
had long ago been filed in the office and we
were afraid he had been forgotten. We longed
to ask Mr. Marcy about it, but did not know
how we could manage to bring the subject to his
notice.
</p>

<p>
"Let's make Ann Eliza ask him," suggested
one. Now, Ann Eliza Ritchie was a beauty, as
fascinating a young creature as the Lord ever made,
irresistible alike to man and woman. She hesitated,â€”everybody
was afraid of Mr. Marcyâ€”but
goaded on by us, she ventured:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Marcy" (Virginia girls always begin
with "Oh"), "Oh, Mr. Marcy! They all want to
know if you are going to appoint Mr. Randolph
in your department."
</p>

<p>
The lion turned. He did not growl, he simply
roared: "<i>What</i> do you mean, madame? How
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25' href='#Page_25'>25</a></span>
<i>dare</i> you take the bull by the horns in this unseemly
manner?"
</p>

<p>
And so no more of Ann Eliza Ritchie. And so
no more of the rest of us. We learned a lesson
we never forgot; namely, not to meddle in Cabinet
affairs, but to content ourselves with the honor
of amusing great men,â€”in short, to know our
place and keep it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Jefferson Davis had been an eminent public
man long before the presidency of Mr. Pierce. He
was a graduate of West Point. He had been an
officer in the Indian wars. He was in the
House of Representatives at the age of thirty-seven.
John Quincy Adams heard his maiden
speech and said: "That young man is no ordinary
man. He will make his mark yet, mind
me." His devotion to reading and study amounted
to a passion. He had served as a colonel in the
Mexican War. It was said of him that "his brilliant
movement at Buena Vista carried the day, and
that his tactical conception was worthy of a CÃ¦sar
or a Napoleon."<a name='FA_2' id='FA_2' href='#FN_2' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>
</p>

<p>
He was afterward a member for four years of
the United States Senate, and although defeated in
a gubernatorial contest in Mississippi, he rose
rapidly in the esteem of the people of his own section;
and now, at the age of forty-five, he was the
"leader of the Southern people, and successor of
John C. Calhoun." He was leader a few years
later in the Battle of the Giants, fought so bitterly
in Mr. Buchanan's time.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26' href='#Page_26'>26</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Of Mr. Caleb Cushing I knew less than I did
of Mr. Davis and Mr. Marcy. He had great
learning, great ability, wide experience in public
life. He has been described as a "scholar, author,
lawyer, statesman, diplomatist, general, and judge."
He was one of the rare class of men who are precocious
in childhood and youth, and who go intellectually
from strength to strength as long as they
live. He was graduated from Harvard when only
seventeen years of age. He was a most attractive
man in manner and address, and a fascinating public
speaker. He could quote the "Iliad" from beginning
to end, and could speak to each one of the
foreign ambassadors in his own tongue.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cushing sent an editorial nearly every day
to the <i>Washington Union</i>, of which my husband was
associate editor. No compliment upon his own
articles which my husband ever received was more
gratefully appreciated than one from Mr. Cushing.
A serious difference of opinion had arisen with the
senior editor, because of a paper upon the Anglo-Russian
war, in which my husband warmly advocated
the side of Russia. He declined retracting
his words (which were copied and translated abroad),
and finally gave up his position on the paper rather
than express sentiments other than his own. Mr.
Cushing applauded him, and bade him stand fearlessly
by an argument, "unanswered and unanswerable."
</p>

<p>
Shortly after this Mr. Pierce appointed my husband
special Minister to Greece. I longed to go
with him to Athens, but my mother's health was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27' href='#Page_27'>27</a></span>
frail, and I felt I could not leave her. So I returned
to my home in Virginia with my children,
and their father went on his mission alone. When
it was accomplished, the Pierce administration was
drawing to a close.
</p>

<p>
My temporary home was near Charlottesville,
and thither, on his way South, came the President
to spend a day and to visit Monticello, the home
of the Father of Democracy. He wrote to me,
inviting me to spend the evening with him and a
few friends at his hotel. We had a delightful evening.
He told me all I wished to know of the exile
far away in Greece, expressed warm friendship for
him and his, and presented me with two gorgeous
volumes, bound sumptuously in green morocco,
and inscribed, from my "friend Franklin Pierce,"
in his own fine handwriting. I played at his request,
he sitting the while beside the piano. I
selected Henselt's "<span lang="fr_FR">L'Elisire d'Amour</span>" and "La
Gondola," to the great delight of the President. The
other day I read, from the pen of some irreverent
critic, of the "lilting puerilities of the innocuous
Henselt." All the same, these puerilities pleased
the President, and will charm the world until the
end of time.
</p>

<p>
I feel that I have said too little of Mr. Pierce in
this sketch of the men we knew. I cannot hope to
convey an adequate conception of his captivating
voice and manner. Surely its source was in genuine
kindness of heart. I knew nothing of him as a
politician. It was urged against him that he was
extremely partial to the South. I know the South
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28' href='#Page_28'>28</a></span>
honored and loved him always. It was said that
"Franklin Pierce could not say 'No'"â€”a weakness
which doubtless caused him a world of trouble in
his political relations, but to which he may have
owed something of the indescribable charm for
which he was conspicuous. Mr. Seward, his political
opponent, wrote to his wife: "The President
has a <i>very</i> winning way in his manners." I can
fully understand the beautiful friendship between
him and Nathaniel Hawthorne. How exquisite the
answer of the author when chidden because he had
dedicated a book to the President, after the latter
had become unpopular: "Unpopular, is he? If
he is so exceedingly unpopular that his name is
enough to sink the volume, there is so much the
more need that an old friend should stand by him."
</p>

<p>
Hawthorne had then arrived at the height of his
own popularity, while his friend, on account of his
fancied Southern sympathies, had lost the friendship
of his own people. A bitter lot for a sensitive
patriot, who had done his best! "An angel can no
more!"
</p>

<p>
My residence in Washington during the Pierce
administration was too short to afford me more
than a brief glimpse of the social life of the city,
but I keenly enjoyed that glimpse. I had the
good fortune to find favor, as I have said, with
the old residents, and also with the Hon. W. W.
Corcoran, at whose house the best of the old and
new could always be found.
</p>

<p>
There I met many distinguished people. I
remember especially General Winfield Scott, Sam
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29' href='#Page_29'>29</a></span>
Houston, and Washington Irving. General Scott,
grand, imposing, and ceremonious, never failed to
tell everybody that he had been groomsman for my
husband's fatherâ€”he had been born in Petersburg,
Virginia. He addressed all young women as "fair
lady." He was a great hero and a splendid old
fellow in every particular, and he never for a moment
forgot his heroism and his splendor. People called
him "vain." So great a man could not be accused
of vanityâ€”"the food of fools." He had a reasonable
pride in what he had achieved, but his was certainly
not the kind of pride that apes humility.
</p>

<p>
As for old Sam Houston, he had had romance
enough in his past life for a dozen heroes. He had
lived many years among the Indians, had fought in
many wars, had achieved the independence of Texasâ€”what
had he not done? Now he was Senator
from Texas, very popular, and rather impatient,
one might judge, of the confinement and restraints
of his position. It was amusing to see the little
pages of the Senate Chamber providing him with
small bundles of soft pine sticks, which he would
smuggle into his desk with a rather shamefaced
expression. Doubled up over this desk, his face
almost covered with his hanging eyebrows and
iron-gray whiskers, he occupied himself in whittling
sticks as a safety-valve for unrest while listening
to the long speeches, lasting sometimes until
midnight. He would prove afterward in his brilliant
conversation that he had not lost a word.
Sometimes the pine under his knife would take
shape in little crosses, amulets, etc. He was known,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30' href='#Page_30'>30</a></span>
now and then, to draw from the pocket of his tiger-skin
vest an exquisitely carved heart and present it
to some young lady whose beauty attracted him.
</p>

<p>
Then there was Washington Irving,â€”an old
man with but a few years to live. He died before
the end of the next administration. One would
never think him old,â€”so keen and alert was he,â€”but
for his trick of suddenly falling asleep for a
minute or two in the middle of a conversation. A
whisper, "Sh-h-h," would pass from one to another,
"Mr. Irving is asleep;" and in a moment he would
wake up, rub his hands, and exclaim, "Well, as we
were saying," taking up the conversation just where
he had left it.
</p>

<p>
My little sister worshipped Mr. Irving. "Only
let me see him," she pleaded; "only let me touch
the hand that wrote the 'Sketch Book.'"
</p>

<p>
I repeated this when I introduced her, and he said:
"Ah, yes, yes! I know! I have heard all that
beforeâ€”many times before. And just as I am getting
happy over it, here comes a young fellow,
some whipper-snapper who never wrote a line, and
[mimicking] it's 'Good evening, Mr. Irving, I am
glad to have met you.'"
</p>

<p>
It happened that my sister had not heard. She was
already distraite. Her favorite friend had appeared,
and she at once echoed, "Good evening, Mr. Irving,
I am glad to have met you," to the old gentleman's
infinite delight and amusement. I was proud
to have had even a word with "America's most celebrated
writer: exquisite in courtesy and fidelity and
of lofty purity of character." He died in 1859â€”the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31' href='#Page_31'>31</a></span>
heart which had ached so long for the death of
an early love failing him suddenly at "Sleepy
Hollow," his home on the Hudson. His country
scarcely noticed his death! That country, crazed
on the subject of slavery, was writing columns on
columns about John Brown.
</p>

<p>
One morning, when I was passing the corner of
Fifteenth Street, below President Square, my steps
were arrested by a large crowd which had assembled
in front of the bank of Corcoran &amp; Riggs. "Dear
me," I thought, "has the bank failed?" But the
green blinds of the plain two-storied building were
all open, and presently through the opening door,
escorted by Mr. Riggs himself, came a slight little
maid in a Connemara cloak and hood. Mr. Riggs
put her in a waiting carriage, slammed the door, and,
with a look which said plainly to the waiting crowd,
"No more this time," reÃ«ntered the house.
</p>

<p>
The little lady was Adelina Pattiâ€”just sixteenâ€”and
Mr. Riggs's guest during the few days she
spent in Washington on her way to meet Southern
engagements. Congressmen tendered her a complimentary
benefit, and she sang in a small hall, supported
by a few local musicians. She stood before
us in a simple muslin slip, her dark hair bound with
a narrow blue velvet ribbon,â€”a Scottish "snood,"â€”and
never, in all her brilliant life, was she more
appreciated, more admired.
</p>

<p>
I could remember a time of musical dearth in
Virginia, relieved only by rare occasions when the
dimly lighted concert rooms would be filled by eager
listeners to wandering minstrels: the Hutchinson
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32' href='#Page_32'>32</a></span>
family, Anna Bishop, the Orpheans, Parodi, and
Amalia Patti. After a while Strakosch appeared with
an infant phenomenon. She looked precisely like a
French doll, with her little round face, pink cheeks,
and big black eyes, dressed in short frocks of rose-color
or blue silk. But she sang like a linnet on
a bough; and it was comical to see her in her duets
inclining her small head toward her contralto, after
the manner of other divas. This was the ten-year-old
Adelina Patti!
</p>

<p>
"What does she keep in her throat?" asked a
little girl near her own ageâ€”adding comfortably,
"Never mind, we will find out when she dies!"
</p>

<p>
Maurice Strakosch accompanied her on a square
piano placed upon the floor, the platform being often
too narrow to admit it. He played, frequently turning
his face to the audience, nodding and smiling, as
if to say:â€”
</p>

<p>
"See this little marvel I have discovered! Is she
not a darling?"
</p>

<p>
The midget had an uncertain temper in those days.
Travelling once in the same car with a lady who took
her fancy, she found an opportunity to free her mind
of her opinion of her troupe: Amalia was jealous of
her; Amalia would shake and pinch her behind the
scenes if the audience applauded her; Strakosch was
utterly horridâ€”just observe his great hands! Not
for worlds would she sing for him were it not for the
sugar-plums!
</p>

<p>
At the end of the journey Strakosch approached
the little girl and held out his hand to take her to
her sister.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33' href='#Page_33'>33</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I am not going with you," said Adelina, "I am
going home with this lady."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but impossible!" said Strakosch.
</p>

<p>
"I will!" said the small rebel. "You know I
always do things when I say 'I will.'"
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" said the lady (she was Mrs. Glasgow,
the lovely mother of Ellen Glasgow, the authoress).
"Why not? Let her come with me! I
will take good care of her."
</p>

<p>
Strakosch shrugged his shoulders. A scene was
imminent. "If I consent, Adelina," he said at last,
"will you be sure to be ready when I come for you
for rehearsal? Will you be sure to sing?"
</p>

<p>
"Will <i>you</i> be sure to bring me back?"
</p>

<p>
"Sureâ€”I promise."
</p>

<p>
"How much candy?" was the next excited
question.
</p>

<p>
"A whole pound."
</p>

<p>
"Noâ€”not enough!"
</p>

<p>
"Two pounds," said Strakosch, glancing around
to satisfy himself that the scene attracted admirers
and possible concert goers.
</p>

<p>
"Not enough," persisted Adelina, shaking her
head.
</p>

<p>
"A hatful!" cried Strakosch, and won the day.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Glasgow devoted herself to the little girl
for the four days of her stay. On the last evening
she invited ten or fifteen child neighbors to a dolls'
party with Adelina Patti. At the end of the evening
she said: "Now, Adelina, these little girls have been
very kind to you. They have brought you lovely
flowersâ€”I wish you to sing one little song for them."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34' href='#Page_34'>34</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A shrewd look possessed the tiny face. "<i>Singâ€”forâ€”them!</i>
Sing without money! <span lang="fr_FR">Mais non! J'ai
toujours beaucoup des fleurs.</span>"
</p>

<p>
She disappeared for a while from public view. I saw
her no more until her visit to Washington. Later,
if I may anticipate, during Mr. Buchanan's administration,
she made her dÃ©but in "Lucia di Lammermoor."
People fought for seats and boxes. Three
rival beauties secured the three bestâ€”tiny, comfortless
stallsâ€”at ninety dollars each. It was something
to see Miss Harriet Lane, Mrs. John R.
Thompson, and Mrs. Stephen A. Douglas in those
three boxes! Each was filled with beautiful women,
and the Cabinet officers and Senators stood behind.
</p>

<p>
"What is all this about?" asked Judge Douglas,
the "Little Giant."
</p>

<p>
"The opera follows Scott's 'Bride of Lammermoor,'"
I gently suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Whose bride was she? Where did she live?"
asked the mighty man, the famous Senator who came
so near being President.
</p>

<p>
"I doubt whether she lived at all," I told him.
"She is a creature of pure imagination, I'm afraid."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said the Senator, contemptuously, and
gave no more attention to the stage nor to the divine
artist upon it.
</p>

<p>
As I had come to Washington from Virginia,
where everybody's great-grandfather knew my great-grandfather,
where the rules of etiquette were only
those of courtesy and good breeding, I had many a
troubled moment in my early Washington life, lest
I should transgress some law of precedence, etc. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35' href='#Page_35'>35</a></span>
wisely took counsel with one of my "old residents,"
and she gave me a few simple rules whereby the
young chaperon of a very young girl might be
guided: "My dear," said this lady, "My dear, you
know you cannot always have your husband to
attend you. It will be altogether proper for you
to go with your sister to morning and afternoon
receptions. When you arrive, send for the host or
the master of ceremonies, and he will take you in
and present you. Of course, your husband will
take you to balls; if he is busy, you simply cannot
go! I think you would do well to make a rule
<i>never</i>, under any circumstances, to drive in men's
carriages. There are so many foreigners here, you
must be careful. They never bring their own court
manners to Washington. They take their cue from
the people they meet. If you are high and haughty,
they will be high and haughty. If you are genially
civil but reserved, they will be so. If you talk
personalities in a free and easy way, they will spring
some audacious piece of scandal on you, and the
Lord only knows where they'll end."
</p>

<p>
Now, it so happened that I had just received a
request from a Frenchman who had brought letters,
to be allowed to escort Madame and Mademoiselle to
a fÃªte in Georgetown. We were to drive through
the avenue of blossoming crab-apples, and rendezvous
at a spring for a picnic. I forget the name of
our hostess, but she had arranged a gay festival,
including music and dancing on the green. I had
accepted this invitation and the escort of M. Raoul,
and received a note from him asking at what hour
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36' href='#Page_36'>36</a></span>
he should have the honor, etc., and I immediately
ran home and wrote that "Madame would be happy
to see M. Raoul <i><span lang="fr_FR">Ã  trois heures</span></i>"â€”and that Madame
asked the privilege of using her own horses, etc. I
made haste to engage an open carriage and congratulated
myself on my clever management.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon was delicious. Monsieur appeared
on the moment, and we waited for my carriage.
The gay equipages of other members of the party
drove up and waited for us. Presently, rattling
down the street, came an old ramshackle "night-hawk,"
bearing the mud-and-dust scars of many
journeys, the seats ragged and tarnished, raw-boned
horses, with rat-eaten manes and tails, harness tied
with rope,â€”the only redeeming feature the old
negro on the box, who, despite his humiliating
<i><span lang="fr_FR">entourage</span></i>, had the air of a gentleman.
</p>

<p>
What could I do? There was nothing to be
done!
</p>

<p>
Monsieur handed me in without moving a muscle
of his face, handed in my sister, entered himself, and
spoke no word during the drive. He conducted us
gravely to the place of rendezvous, silently and
gravely walked around the grounds with us, silently
and gravely brought us home again.
</p>

<p>
I grew hot and cold by turns, and almost shed
tears of mortification. I made no apologyâ€”what
could I say? Arriving at my own door, I turned
and invited my escort to enter. He raised his hat
and, with an air of the deepest dejection, dashed with
something very like sarcastic humility, said he
trusted Madame had enjoyed the afternoonâ€”thanked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37' href='#Page_37'>37</a></span>
her for the honor done himselfâ€”and
only regretted the disappointment of the French
Minister, the Count de Sartiges, at not having been
allowed to serve Madame with his own state coach,
which had been placed at his disposal for Madame's
pleasure!
</p>

<p>
As he turned away my chagrin was such I came
near forgetting to give my coachman his little
"tip."
</p>

<p>
I began, "Oh, Uncle, how <i>could</i> you?" when he
interrupted: "Now, Mistis, don't you say nothin'.
I knowed dis ole fune'al hack warn't fittin' for you,
but der warn't nar another kerridge in de stable.
De boss say, 'Go 'long, Jerry, an' git 'er dar!'â€”an'
I done done it! An' I done fotch 'er back,
too!"
</p>

<p>
I never saw M. Raoul afterward. There's no
use crying over spilt milk, or broken eggs, or
French monsieurs, or even French counts and
Ministers. I soon left for Virginia, and to be
relieved of the dread of meeting M. Raoul softened
my regret at leaving Washington.

<h2>
CHAPTER III
<br />
<span class="s05">ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT BUCHANAN</span>
</h2>

<p>
Two days after Mr. Buchanan's inauguration,
the nominations for the Cabinet were sent
to the Senate. The venerable Lewis Cass,
with many years of honorable service behind him,
was Secretary of State,â€”selected, the "Old-Line
Whigs" said, because the President meant really to
be Secretary of State himself, and he wished an amiable
first assistant. Moreover, he liked to say "old
Lewis Cass," as though he were himself so much
younger. Hon. Howell Cobb of Georgia had the
Treasury Department. He was a man of political
ability, "frank and genial," sagacious and conservative,
"qualities fitting him well to dominate his
associates." Mr. Floyd, who "belonged to the first
families of Virginia," was the Secretary of War. Mr.
Toucey of Connecticut was Secretary of the Navy,
Mr. Jacob Thompson of Mississippi, Secretary of
the Interior, Mr. Brown of Tennessee, Postmaster-General,
and Judge Jeremiah Black, Attorney-General,â€”three
from the North, four from the
South. The new Cabinet, people said, was far
inferior in capacity to the retiring one.
</p>

<p>
The new President was a bachelor. Despite his
years and his cold, reserved manner, his fidelity to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39' href='#Page_39'>39</a></span>
the memory of beautiful Miss Coleman, to whom he
had been affianced in his youth, invested him with
the interest which attaches to romance. This was
enhanced by his devotion to his niece, Miss Harriet
Lane. In her affection he found the only solace of
his lonely life. For her sake he condescended to
unbend in public; and to brighten the atmosphere
around her, he sometimes became quite a jaunty old
bachelor. She was his confidante in all matters
political and personal. A stately etiquette ruled
between the two. She was always addressed as
"Miss Harriet," and to her he was "The President"â€”never
"Uncle Buchanan," except on the rare
occasions when she considered it worth her while to
coax him in order to carry a point.
</p>

<p>
Washington was never gayer than during this
administration, more memorable than any other
except Washington's and Lincoln's. The mighty
giants of the House and Senate were there, the men
who must be held largely responsible for that most
unnecessary, cruel, and wicked warâ€”the war between
the Northern and Southern states of America.
Washington was the storm centre, charged with the
electric forces so soon to burst in fury upon the
country.
</p>

<p>
But before we enter upon these troubled times,
we will live over again some of the happy, care-forgetting
months of our life in Washington.
</p>

<p>
My husband who had succeeded Mr. Ritchie as
one of the editors of the <i>Richmond Enquirer</i> was now
a member of Congress. He had accomplished his
mission to Greece to the satisfaction of his government
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40' href='#Page_40'>40</a></span>
and to his own pleasure and profit. With a
good courier and a generous country at his back, he
had traversed Europe, had seen Venice rise from
the sea, had revelled in the grandeur that wasâ€”and
isâ€”Rome, had beheld the mosques and minarets of
the Byzantine city from the waters of the Golden
Horn, had looked into the inscrutable eyes of the
Sphinx, and had finally taken up his abode under
the shadow of the Acropolis. There he had met the
"Maid of Athens," now stout, middle-aged Mrs.
Black, so the poor American Minister, who was
young and romantic,â€”in order to understand the
passionate entreaty of Byron to return the wandering
heart of him or else take the rest of him,â€”was constrained
to think of the poem, and look the while at
a dark-eyed Greek beauty named "Elpis"â€”at least
this was the explanation made to me of his frequent
allusions in his letters to the latter. There, too, he
had charmed Queen Mathilde with a description of
the night-blooming cereus of this country and had
stricken the court of King Otho dumb with amazement
by outrageous American boasting.
</p>

<p>
"Kindly tell us, your Excellency," inquired the
king at a state banquet, "what subject most interests
your country at the present moment."
</p>

<p>
"The problem, may it please your Majesty, of
how we shall govern our superfluous territory and
invest our superfluous treasure."
</p>

<p>
This may not have pleased his Majesty, but it
certainly astounded him. Little Greece was, at the
moment, hemmed in by organized bands of brigands
and sorely pressed for the means of existence.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41' href='#Page_41'>41</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Our envoy had the honor, too, of attending, with
Madame le Vert, the ball at the HÃ´tel de Ville, and of
witnessing the opening quadrille, danced by Victoria
and Albert, Louis Napoleon and his sister Mathilde,
the empress being ill. Both queen and
princess seemed young and happy, both attired in
white satin flounced with point lace, and wearing a
prince's ransom in jewels.
</p>

<p>
The weather was fearfully hot, and the royal
party danced but once. The queen did not step a
stately measure, dancing "high and disposedly";â€”but
she entered into the spirit of the hour
heartily, and, although the mother of eight children,
danced with the glee of a young girl, growing
withal very red in the face like any ordinary mortal.
</p>

<p>
At one of the gala days of the Exposition in
Paris, a very large woman attracted much attention.
She was neither young nor handsome, but
had a comfortable, well-to-do air of content. A
profusion of light curls clustered around her rotund
face. These ringlets were all that was left of the
beauty of the Countess Guiccioli! Alas, there was
no "Elpis" at hand for consolation. All these
things and more would have appeared in a charming
volume but for the secession of South Carolina, as
will be seen later on in my story.
</p>

<p>
I never regretted the loss of this beautiful opportunity
in my life. My mother had been nursed back
to bless me and mine a few years longer. Moreover,
I found myself enriched. I had pictures, ravishing
pictures, Raphael's "Belle Jardiniere," a priceless
Raffaello Morghen's proof impression of the "Madonna
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42' href='#Page_42'>42</a></span>
della Seggiola," Guido's "Aurora" with its
glorious womenâ€”the most glorious being (if she
would only turn around) the one with her back
to the world. I had many others, Titian, Domenichino,
Murillo, Leonardo da Vinci. I had amber
from Constantinople, curios and antiques from
Egypt, corals and cameos from Naples and Florence,
silks from Broussa (afterward swallowed up
by an earthquake), silks and velvets from Lyons,
laces from Brussels, perfumes from the land of
Araby the blest,â€”things mightily consoling to a
woman in her early twenties.
</p>

<p>
We found a large house on New York Avenue
and filled it with good Virginia servants. Admonished
by experience, we secured horses and a careful
coachman.
</p>

<p>
We had come to stay! My husband represented
the old district of his kinsman, John Randolph of
Roanoke, and his constituents were devoted to him.
They would never supplant him with another. Of
that we might be sure. God granting life and
health, we were going to be happy young people.
</p>

<p>
The market in Washington was abundantly
supplied with the finest game and fish from the
Eastern Shore of Maryland and Virginia, and the
waters of the Potomac. Brant, ruddy duck, canvasback
duck, sora, oysters, and terrapin were
within the reach of any housekeeper. Oysters,
to be opened at a moment's notice, were planted
on the cellar floors, and fed with salt water, and the
cellars, as far as the mistress was concerned, were
protected from invasion by the large terrapins kept
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43' href='#Page_43'>43</a></span>
thereâ€”a most efficient police force, crawling about
with their outstretched necks and wicked eyes.
</p>

<p>
Such dainties demanded expert cooking. We
found in our house a portly family servant, "Aunt
Susan," who had been left as caretaker with permission
to remain or not as the new tenant should
please, or as she herself should please. I fell in
love with her on sight and found her willing to
engage with me.
</p>

<p>
"Can you cook, Aunt Susan?" I imprudently
inquired.
</p>

<p>
"No'm, I don't call myself a cook, but I know a
hogfish from a yellow-bellied perch, and a canvasback
duck from a redhead. I could cook oysters
to suit my own white folks."
</p>

<p>
We had brought with us a number of servants
who had lived with us in Virginia. They were free.
We never owned slaves; this one free family had
served us always.
</p>

<p>
A serious difficulty immediately arose in the
kitchen. Susan felt her dignity insulted. She
had supposed I would bring "gentlefolks' servants
from the Eastern Sho'." She had not "counted on
free niggers to put on airs an' boss her in her own
kitchen."
</p>

<p>
My Virginia servants protested absolute humility
and innocence. But that was not all. A French
woman, Adele RiviÃ¨re, was sewing in the nursery,
and an Englishman, George Boyd, was coachman.
Susan wanted "only one mistress," she had "not
counted on working for furriners. By the time she
had pleased that Frenchwoman and Englishman and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44' href='#Page_44'>44</a></span>
them free niggers" she "wouldn't have enough
sperrit left to wipe her foot on the door-mat."
</p>

<p>
A compromise was effected, however. Susan
was to be queen on her own premises; and if she
<i>must</i> occasionally "put on airs" herself and "boss"
somebody, why she might always "boss" me.
</p>

<p>
"I think," said my friend Agnes, "you have very
neatly arranged to have as much trouble as possible.
The question of caste will crop up every hour of the
day. If the worst comes to the worst, let them all
go except Susan! Harriet Martineau gives fine
advice, for an old maid: 'Never <i>nag</i> your servantsâ€”but
if occasion demands, come down upon them
like the day of judgment.'"
</p>

<p>
"I stand by Susan," I assured her, "whatever she
does. I am dreadfully opposed to capital punishment,
but if anybody kills a cook, he needn't bring
his case to our office."
</p>

<p>
Susan had offended, by her assumption of superiority,
all the members of my household except myself,
to whom she was most kind and respectful.
The boy James had been brought by his aunts, who
promised to train him for my service. He soon
developed an ingenuity in teasing the cook amounting
to inspiration. Matters between them reached
a crisis one morning. I was reading my paper in
the office adjoining the breakfast-room when I heard
Susan's raucous voice: "What do you mean coming
in this kitchen hollerin' out 'Susan, Susan'?
Whar's your manners?"
</p>

<p>
"I loant 'em to de cook dis mornin', Susanâ€”leastways
Miss Moss! I always disremembers yo'
entitlements."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45' href='#Page_45'>45</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Well, you just get out of this kitchen! I can
send breakfast up on the dumb waiter. You stay
in your own place."
</p>

<p>
"I kin make myse'f skase, Miss Moss, but dat
ain't de pint. Cose de dumb waiter can't talk, an' I
has to speak about clean plates an'â€”"
</p>

<p>
"Get out o' here, I tell you. <i>Clean</i>, indeed! And
your face not washed this morning! An' you all
pizened up with scent likeâ€”"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Lawd</i>, Miss Moss! <i>Don't</i> say what I'se like!
An' what I gwine fling water in my face for? I ain'
no house afire."
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes Susan, her ample figure endowed
with a fresh white apron, and her bandanna turban
tied to a nicety, presented herself, dropped a courtesy,
and said with perfect politeness:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Honey, I hate to worry you, but I'm afraid the
time has come when you must choose between me
and the free nigger. I think too much of myself
to mind his impudence, but everything smells and
tastes of his strong scentsâ€”which I know will never
suit you nor the master. I, for one, can't stand
'em."
</p>

<p>
"Then James must leave at once," said I, firmly.
"He knows the perfume is forbidden, and I have
myself heard his disrespectful language to you."
</p>

<p>
But James had no idea of leaving Washington
and returning to the position of knife-cleaner in the
Petersburg hotel, whence I had taken him. He
experienced a total change of heart. He surrendered
in magnificent style. I was too skilful a general not
to press my advantage. Then and there I confiscated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46' href='#Page_46'>46</a></span>
his entire stock of spurious attar of rose. It
could not be buried, because the court was paved;
it could not be emptied in the waste-water pipes, lest
we remember it forever; but I opened the doors of
Susan's kitchen range, and laid it, a burnt-offering
to her offended dignity, upon the glowing coals.
I then went calmly in to my coffee, which had a
distinctly Oriental flavor that morning.
</p>

<p>
Things went smoothly after this. The prevailing
spirit of secession found its way only as far as the
nursery, when pretty Adele RiviÃ¨re entered a convent
(with but one expressed regret, that the bonnets
were so unbecoming), and a dear little genius, Annie
Powers, took her place,â€”coming regularly for fifty
cents a day, and making me independent of the elusive
dressmakers who lorded and queened it over
my unhappy friends.
</p>

<p>
And just here I feel constrained to apologize to
my friend who has, at this moment, this page before
him, for recording so many trifling incidents; but in
painting a faithful picture of any time, the little lights
and shadows cannot be left out. Nothing is unimportant.

CHAPTER IV
<br />
<span class="s05">SOCIAL LIFE DURING BUCHANAN'S ADMINISTRATION</span>
</h2>

<p>
We attended Dr. Gurley's church and found
that the President also had taken a seat
in that church. Our own was near the
door, and for many Sundays before I knew him,
I was interested in seeing him enter the church and
walk briskly up to his pew near the pulpit (while
the bell was ringing), buttoned in his broadcloth
coat, wearing no overcoat in the coldest weather.
Immediately after the benediction he would walk
rapidly down the aisle, the congregation standing
until he passed. Miss Lane attended St. John's
Church, and the President was accompanied only by
his secretary, Mr. Buchanan Henry. After I knew
him quite well, I always spoke to him when he
passed me near the door and I sometimes ventured,
"A good sermon, Mr. President!" he never failing
to reply, "Too long, Madam, too long."
</p>

<p>
I was leading a very happy domestic life, busy
with my little boys and my housekeeping, proud of
my self-constituted office as my Congressman's private
secretary, much exercised in sending documents,
seeds, and cuttings (we were introducing tea-culture
in Virginia) to his constituents, when I was called to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48' href='#Page_48'>48</a></span>
order by our dear old friend, Mr. Dudley Mann,
an old politician, diplomat, and "society man."
</p>

<p>
"Madam, did you come to Washington to live
in your own house and write letters to farmers?"
</p>

<p>
"What better could I do?"
</p>

<p>
"The President does not agree with you. He
admires your husband and wonders why you were
not at the Levee. He has asked me to see that you
come to the next one."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be on a committee that night," said my
Congressman, hastily,â€”he was usually on a committee
when a reception was to the fore.
</p>

<p>
"I will take her myself," said Mr. Mann. "Now,
wear a pretty evening dress of silk or velvet. Can
it be lavender? And I will call precisely at nine."
</p>

<p>
I appreciated the honor of Mr. Mann's escort,
and, wishing to please him, procured the lavender
silk. Our evening gowns were cut straight across
the neck, and finished with a bertha of lace. The
full skirt was distended over a large hoop. An
elaborate headdress of flowers or marabout feathers
was <i><span lang="fr_FR">de rigueur</span></i> for a levee, which, however, demanded
simpler attire than a ball or a dinner. Our white
gloves were short and were finished at the wrist with
a fall of lace three or four inches wide, and a band of
ribbon and rosette.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mann approved my attire and gave me a
very good time. The crowd was great and the
amplitude and length of the ladies' robes filled me
with anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Mr. Mann," I said, "pray be careful not to
tread on the trains."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49' href='#Page_49'>49</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"My child," he answered, "I haven't lifted my
feet for twenty years!"
</p>

<p>
The President detained us for a few courteous
words, and we were passed on to Miss Lane, standing,
not beside him, but in a group with other ladies.
Thence we found our way to the East Room, and a
great many ladies and gentlemen were introduced
to me, as I stood on the arm of my courtly escort.
</p>

<p>
Such a number of cards came to us after this that
the housekeeping, the writing, the little boys, the
seeds, and the tea-culture in Virginia were likely to
suffer.
</p>

<p>
The reign of the "afternoon tea" was not yetâ€”at
least not in Washington; but entertainments
included morning receptions, evening receptions,
dinners, musicales, children's parties, old-fashioned
evening parties with music and supper, and splendid
balls. So many of these were crowded into a season
that we often attended three balls in one evening.
</p>

<p>
The first time I dined with the President I made
early and elaborate preparation. When the great
day arrived, all my paraphernalia, rosetted slippers,
gloves, fan, dress, and wrap were duly laid out on
my bed and sofa. In the evening I seated myself
at a dressing table and submitted my head to FranÃ§ois'
hands. The evening coiffure was elaborate and
troublesome. The hair in front was stiffened with
bandoline, and formed into sleek, smooth bandeaux,
framing the face. Behind, all the hair was tightly
tied, low at the nape of the neck, then divided into
two parts, and each woven with many strands into
a wide braid. These were curved from ear to ear
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50' href='#Page_50'>50</a></span>
to form a basket, and within the basket were roses,
or pond-lilies, or violets, with long trailing vines
floating behind.
</p>

<p>
FranÃ§ois was a very agreeable talker. He had
dressed Rachel's hair and was leisurely giving a
charming lecture on Rachel's art. Suddenly my
husband burst in: "The carriage is at the door!
Hurry, hurry! We've only ten minutes to reach
the White House."
</p>

<p>
I literally leaped into my gown, had no time for
flowers or jewels, snatched up my gloves, left everything
else, and ran! We entered the green room
just as Mr. Buchanan Henry was arranging the
guests for dinner. Luckily I was low down on his
list.
</p>

<p>
I was miserably heated, and very uncomfortable
lest I should not be able to conceal my Congress
gaiters, having had no time to change them. My
gloves were on, but not buttoned. To add to my
misfortunes I found I was to be taken in by a
Southern Congressman who was alreadyâ€”well, not
exactly himself. To my horror he winked at Miss
Lane when he drank wine with her. When a side
dish was handed, he said audibly: "Now look here,
Joe! Is that the same old thing you gave me here
last year? Because if it is, I don't want any of it."
After we returned to the parlor I confided my miseries
to the lady who had been placed next him at
dinner, and she reassured me: "Oh, that's nothing!
Such things happen here any dayâ€”nobody notices
these people from the rural districts."
</p>

<p>
This was worse than the ramshackle carriage.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51' href='#Page_51'>51</a></span>
Could I bear to be classed with "people from the
rural districts?" I was never a moment late afterward.
</p>

<p>
Dinners at the White House were much less elaborate
in their appointments than were dinners at the
homes of the wealthy Cabinet officers and Senators.
Mr. Buchanan set an example of Republican simplicity.
Few flowers were placed in the drawing
rooms. In the centre of the Blue Room there was
a divan surrounding a stand of potted plants and
surmounted by a small palm. The dinner table
was not ornamented with flowers, nor were bouquets
at the covers. A long plateau, a mirror edged
with a hunting scene (gilt figures in high relief), extended
down the middle, and from the centre and at
the two ends rose epergnes with small crystal dishes
for bonbons and cakes.
</p>

<p>
One evening the President said to me, "Madam,
what is this small shrub I find always placed before
me?"
</p>

<p>
"If the berries were white, Mr. President, it would
be <i><span lang="la">Ardisia alba</span></i>."
</p>

<p>
"Ah," he answered, "I am all right! My berries
are redâ€”I have '<i><span lang="la">Ardisia rufa</span></i>!' Miss Harriet
has the <i><span lang="la">alba</span></i>!"
</p>

<p>
There were no other floral decorations on the
table.
</p>

<p>
I once ventured to send the President a Virginia
ham, with particular directions for cooking it. It
was to be soaked, boiled gently three or four hours,
suffered to get cold in its own juices, and then toasted.
</p>

<p>
This would seem simple enough, but the executive
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>52</a></span>
cook disdained it, perhaps for the reason that it
was so simple. The dish, a shapeless, jellylike mass,
was placed before the President. He took his knife
and fork in hand to honor the dish by carving it
himself, looked at it helplessly, and called outâ€”"Take
it away! Take it away! Oh, Miss Harriet!
You are a poor housekeeper! Not even a Virginia
lady can teach you."
</p>

<p>
The glass dishes of the epergne contained wonderful
"French kisses"â€”two-inch squares of crystallized
sugar wrapped in silver paper, and elaborately
decorated with lace and artificial flowers. I was
very proud at one dinner when the President said
to me, "Madam, I am sending you a souvenir for
your little daughter," and a waiter handed me one
of those gorgeous affairs. He had questioned me
about my boys, and I had told him of my daughter
Gordon, eight years old, who lived with her grandmother.
"You must bring her to see Miss Harriet,"
he had saidâ€”which, in due season, I did; an event,
with its crowning glory of a checked silk dress, white
hat and feather, which she proudly remembers to
this day. Having been duly presented at court,
the little lady was much "in society" and accompanied
me to many brilliant afternoon functions.
</p>

<p>
She was a thoughtful listener to the talk in her
father's library, and once when an old politician
spoke sadly of a possible rupture of the United
States, surprised and delighted him by slipping her
hand in his and saying, "Never mind! <i>United</i> will
spell <i>Untied</i> just as well"â€”a little <i><span lang="fr_FR">mot</span></i> which was
remembered and repeated long afterwards.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53' href='#Page_53'>53</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Buchanan's kind notice of her is gratefully
recollected. It was said that he was influenced by
the Southern Senators and Representatives. I only
know he was most kind to us, and I refuse to believe
we were of consequence enough to make this
kindness a matter of policy. I would fain think he
really liked us, really desired to add to our happiness.
</p>

<p>
It cannot be said that his niece, Miss Harriet
Lane, although universally admired, was a popular
woman. She lacked magnetism. She followed a
prescribed rule of manner from which she never
deviated, no matter with whom she was thrown.
This was, perhaps, fortunate. Always courteous,
always in place, silent whenever it was possible to
be silent, watchful, and careful, she made no enemies,
was betrayed into no entangling alliances, and was involved
in no contretemps of any kind.
</p>

<p>
She was very handsome, a fair, blue-eyed, self-contained
young woman. She was dignifiedâ€”as
indeed all women had to be, in gesture at least,
when they wore great hoops! The "curtsy" was a
perilous duty. "How does she do it? She never
makes a cheese of herself," said one, looking on at
a morning reception. Miss Lane's courtesy was the
perfection of deference and grace. And she had
exquisite taste in dress. She never wore many ornaments,
many flowers, nor the billows of ruffles then in
fashion. I remember her in white tulle, with a
wreath of clematis; in soft brown or blue silk; in
much white muslin, dotted and plain, with blue
ribbons run in puffs on skirt and bodice.
</p>

<p>
She was very affable and agreeable, in an unemotional
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54' href='#Page_54'>54</a></span>
wayâ€”the proper manner, of course, for her.
I imagine no one could take a liberty with her then,
but I risked the experiment some years ago when
we spent a summer together at Bar Harbor. A
handsome widow, with silver hair, she was even
more <i><span lang="fr_FR">distinguÃ©</span></i> than she had been in the White
House. I recalled, to her genuine amusement, two
incidents of her life there. When she took her
place as mistress of the Executive Mansion, the
President had given her but one rule for her conduct:
never under any circumstances to accept a
present. "Think of my feelings," she had said to
me, "when the lovely lacquered boxes and tables
the Japanese Embassy brought me were turned from
the door, to say nothing of the music-boxes and
these fascinating sewing-machines they have just
invented."
</p>

<p>
A party was once made up for a visit to Mount
Vernon. Mr. Augustus Schell of New York accompanied
Miss Lane. He was a fine-looking fellow and
very much in love with her. As they walked along
the banks of the Potomac, she picked up a handful
of colored pebbles. Mr. Schell requested them of
her and put them in his pocket. He took them to
Tiffany, had them beautifully polished, set with
diamonds, and linked together in a bracelet, and
sent them as "a souvenir of Mount Vernon" to Miss
Lane for a Christmas gift.
</p>

<p>
She carried them for a week in her pocket, trying to
get her own consent to give them up. The more she
looked at them the better she liked them. One day
the President was in fine spirits. He liked to rally
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55' href='#Page_55'>55</a></span>
her about Lord Lyons, which she did not fancy
overmuch. But this time she humored him, and at
last ventured to say, "Uncle Buchanan, if I have
a few pretty pebbles given me, you do not object to
my accepting them?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, Miss Harriet! Keep your pebbles!
Keep your pebbles," he exclaimed, in high good
humor.
</p>

<p>
"You know," Miss Lane said, in telling me the
story at the time, "diamonds are pebbles."
</p>

<p>
There was an impression that she never condescended
to the rÃ´le of a coquette, but I could testify
to the contrary.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Porcher Miles, Congressman from South
Carolina, was one of her train of devoted admirers.
He accompanied me once to an evening reception
at the White House. Miss Lane stood in front of
the flower-trimmed divan in the Blue Room. Mr.
Miles and I paid our respects, lingered awhile, and,
having other engagements, sent for our carriage.
</p>

<p>
As we stood at the door waiting, he talked of
Miss Lane's beauty and charmâ€”"Look at her
where she stands! Is she not the personification of
a high-bred lady from head to foot?"
</p>

<p>
Miss Lane perceived we were talking about her,â€”and
while she gave her right hand to the arriving
guests she passed her left behind her and plucked a
spray of mignonette. We saw her beckon a servant,
who immediately found us, and gave the flowers to
Mr. Miles, "with Miss Lane's compliments."
</p>

<p>
I repeated these two little stories to her when her
head was silvered,â€”less by age than by sorrow,â€”and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56' href='#Page_56'>56</a></span>
awoke one of those rare moonlight smiles which
her friends remember so well.
</p>

<p>
No one who observed Mr. Buchanan could fail
to perceive the rapid change in him after he became
President. Having committed himself to the policy
of rotation in office, he was overwhelmed with the
persistence of place hunters. "They give me no
time to say my prayers," he complained. They
exhausted him in listening to their petty interests
at a time when the most important problems that
ever confronted the head of the nation clamored for
his consideration.
</p>

<p>
Toward the last, when the older men almost gave
up hope, his only prayer was that the catastrophe of
conflict might not come in his day. He cannot be
blamed above others for hesitation, vacillation. The
problems were too mighty for one man's wisdom,
too mighty for the collective wisdom of many.
</p>

<p>
Lord and Lady Napier were interesting members
of Washington society. They occupied the house
built by Admiral Porter on H Street, near Fourteenth,
now the residence of the French Embassy. They
had succeeded Mr. Crampton, and were themselves
succeeded in 1859 by Lord Lyonsâ€”so we had
three British Ministers within a few years. Lord
and Lady Napier gave delightful entertainmentsâ€”dinners,
musicales, receptions, evening parties. My
Lady was more admired than were any of her predecessors.
She was lovely in person, gentle, cultivated,
most affable and approachable. At her receptions,
and even at her balls, her sons, charming boys of ten
and twelve, were always present to help her receive
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57' href='#Page_57'>57</a></span>
her guests. Everything she did, everything she said,
seemed wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best. We
have had no representative from the court of St.
James who did so much for the entertainment of
our own people as Lord and Lady Napier.
</p>

<p>
They gave a splendid ball in 1858 in honor of
the queen's birthday. Lady Napier was superb in
a tiara of diamonds and emeralds. Lord Napier
and all the foreign Ministers shone forth in all the
splendor of court dress; and everybody must concedeâ€”Mr.
Marcy to the contrary notwithstandingâ€”that
the glitter of gold lace and gems, the distinction
of orders, the imperial stars and decorations,
do add to the interest of such an occasion. They
mean much. They mean honor achieved, services
recognized.
</p>

<p>
A recording Jenkins of this ball dilates upon the
elegance of the supper, "this vista of gold and silver
plate and the more than epicurean daintiness of the
delicacies, the age and vintage of the wines."
</p>

<p>
The most interesting ball of the season was that
given by the Senators and Representatives to Lord
and Lady Napier just before they returned to
England.
</p>

<p>
We were early arrivals at this ball, because we
wished to see the sanded floor of the ball room,
representing in colors St. George and the Dragon,
before it should be effaced by the dancers.
</p>

<p>
Lord and Lady Napier were seated on a dais at
the head of the room, and we passed in review
before them. Lady Napier was attired in rich
white satin, embroidered with pearls, with a close
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58' href='#Page_58'>58</a></span>
"Juliet cap" of pearls on her hair. No lofty throne
could make her less gracious than was her wont.
</p>

<p>
Dion Boucicault gave me his arm at the door, and
after our obeisance walked around the room to show
me the portraits and paintings. On the right of
Lord and Lady Napier was a full-length portrait of
young Victoria in her ermine robe and crown, and
on the left, one of Washington. "Alas, alas," said
Mr. Boucicault, "that so great a man should have
been painted with cramp in his fingers!" My escort
was altogether charming. I discovered he was "putting
in time" with me, for presently here came little
Agnes Robertson, just from the theatre, where she
had been playing in the "Siege of Lucknow," and I
lost Mr. Boucicault! He married her soon afterward.
And <i>afterward</i>! Ah, well! That is none
of the business of this story.
</p>

<p>
When we entered the banquet hall, Lady Napier's
exclamations were enthusiastic. "Look, George,"
she cried, "there is the knight and his dragon againâ€”all
in sugar! And here are the English arms
andâ€”oh, George! here are our own arms!" Gautier
had excelled himself. There were glittering
haystacks of spun sugar; wonderful Roman chariots,
drawn by swans, and driven by Cupids; pyramids
of costly bonbons; dolphins in a sea of rock
candy; and ices in every form from a pair of turtle
doves to a pillared temple. Gautier spread all his
tables in this fashion, the grosser dishes of game,
terrapin, and canvasback being served from a buffet.
</p>

<p>
Washington suppers in the fifties were superb.
One wondered if we might not some day return
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59' href='#Page_59'>59</a></span>
to the feasts of the Roman emperors, the tables of
cedar and ivory incrusted with jewels, the movable
ceilings representing the celestial spheres, the
showers of violets and roses which rained down on
the guests in the intervals between the courses of
peacocks' brains and nightingales' tongues, the
trumpets which greeted the appearance of the stuffed
peacocks with spread plumage. Time has really
changed our supper fashions less than we imagine.
Music, delicate wines, confectionery in fanciful forms,
silver dishes, flowers, perfumed water for the fingers,
were all fashionable in the fourteenth century. We
smile to read of the flocks of living birds and the
stuffed fowls that adorned the boards of the Neapolitan
kings. But it has not been many years since,
at a banquet given in New York to Ex-President
Cleveland by the Manhattan Club, a tank was
placed in the middle of the table where living terrapins
crawled about and were thoughtful spectators
of the fate of the <i><span lang="fr_FR">terrapin Ã  la Maryland</span></i>. And at
intervals around the board, stuffed pheasants contemplated
the flight of the <i><span lang="fr_FR">faisan rÃ´ti</span></i> down Democratic
throats. Benedetti Salutati in 1476 never did
better than this. And, compared with these ancients
and moderns, M. Gautier was extremely refined,
and only a bit anachronistic with his Roman chariots,
Cupids, and swans.
</p>

<p>
People were wont to remark upon the atmosphere
the lovely Lady Napier seemed to bring with her
everywhere. Those who were admitted into her
<i><span lang="la">sanctum sanctorum</span></i>, her little boudoir, fancied they
could explain it. Upon her table was much silver
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60' href='#Page_60'>60</a></span>
marked with her coronet and initials, and beside
these was a rosewood book rack containing half a
dozen volumesâ€”a Bible, a "Treatise on Practical
Religion," "The Mount of Olivet," "Paradise of
the Christian Soul," "The Christian Year," "Child's
Catechism," "Life of Dean Ramsey." These were
the pure waters from which Lady Napier drank daily.
"Ninia Napier" was written in a delicate Italian
hand on the fly-leaf of each volume.
</p>

<p>
My acquaintance with Lord Napier was slight.
Judge Douglas introduced him to me at a ball. He
stood some seconds without speaking. At last he
raised his cold blue eyes and asked, "Have you
been long at this place?" I answered, "No, my
Lord!" Ten words had passed between us, with
which he seemed to be satisfied. But Lady Napier
I knew well. She returned all visits, and mine
among the rest.
</p>

<p>
England and Russia had been at war, and peace
had recently been concluded. Of all the foreign
Ministers I knew best the English and Russian.
Baron StoÃ«ckle, then the Russian Envoy, and
Baron Bodisco, his predecessor (I am not sure
about the "Baron"), I knew very well, and I
cordially liked their wives. This does not imply
that their wives, both American, liked each other.
</p>

<p>
Madame Bodisco, laden with diamonds, looked
with disfavor upon Madame StoÃ«ckle, young, blue-eyed,
and in simple attire. The latter was from
Massachusetts; the former had been a beautiful
Georgetown girl, whom the baron, passing her
father's orchard, had spied in a blossoming apple
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61' href='#Page_61'>61</a></span>
tree, and to whom he had forthwith lost his Russian
and baronial heart. Madame Bodisco was an enthusiastic
Southern sympathizer. At Madame
StoÃ«ckle's own table, after she had related an amusing
anecdote, Madame Bodisco whispered to me,
"Will you listen to that Yankee woman with her
'<i>says she's</i>' and '<i>says I's</i>'!"
</p>

<p>
Of course politics, in this seething time, were
never alluded to in any company, least of all in the
presence of our foreign envoys. It required skill;
but we kept the talk upon "literature and flowers,"
the birds and fishes of different lands, anything,
everything, except the topic of all-consuming interest.
But at one of Baron StoÃ«ckle's very genial
dinners, one of us, to test his ingenuity, said: "Come
now, Baron! Here we are, Republican and Democrat!
Show your colors! Where do you belong?"
"Alas, dear lady," said the wily diplomat, "I am
an orphan! I belong nowhere! I am an <i>Old-Line
Whig</i>." This party had just become extinct.
</p>

<p>
One of the exciting events during the Buchanan
administration was the arrival in Washington of the
first embassy from Japanâ€”the Japan which for
hundreds of years had been governed by the dominant
idea: "to preserve unchanged the condition
of the native intelligence" and to "prevent the
introduction of new ideas." The government had
maintained a rigid policy of isolation, "living like
frogs in a well," until 1853, when they were rudely
awakened from their dream of peace and security
by Commodore Perry sailing into the harbor of
Yokohama with a squadron of United States war
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62' href='#Page_62'>62</a></span>
vessels. By dignity, resolution, argument, and
promise, he extorted a treaty in 1854â€”and thus
Japan entered the family of nations.
</p>

<p>
We had much curiosity about the Japanese. We
read Perry's "Expedition" with keen interest, and
were delighted with the prospect of receiving the embassy
from the new land. Arrangements were made
for a series of entertainments, invitations were already
issuedâ€”one to the White House to witness the
presentation of credentials and the reception of the
President.
</p>

<p>
At last we heard that the strangers had landed
and would soon arrive. I was in the gallery of the
Senate Chamber with an intimate friend. We were
doubtful about going out with the crowd of citizens
to meet the Japanese, and were hoping that the
Senate and House would adjourn. Presently a
member rose and said: "Mr. President, the first
Ambassadors from the venerable country of Japan
are about to arrive. I move the Senate do now
adjourn to meet and welcome the Japanese."
</p>

<p>
Immediately another Senator was on his feet,
not to second the motion, but to say sharply, "Mr.
President, I humbly trust the Senate of the United
States of America will not adjourn for every show
that comes along." That settled it. My friend
and I hurried to our carriage, and meeting the cortÃ¨ge,
turned just in time to drive side by side with
the first landau containing the Ambassadors.
</p>

<p>
Our progress was slow and often interruptedâ€”and
we had abundant time to observe the two dignitaries
close beside us in the first carriage. They sat,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63' href='#Page_63'>63</a></span>
fanning themselves, without looking to right or left.
The one next me was extremely wrinkled and witheredâ€”doubtless
the greater manâ€”and he was so
wooden, so destitute of expression that Iâ€”oh, this
is <i>much</i> worse than the episode of the ramshackle
hack! How can I confess that I "lost my head."
The old creature, with his wrinkled, yellow face,
turban, short gown, and petticoats looked so very
like my old mulatto mammy, the darling of my
childhood, thatâ€”I leaned over and put my pearl-handled
fan on his knee, motioning to him to give
me his in exchange. The old gentleman looked
startled for an instant, but he soon understood, and
I became the first possessor of a Japanese fan. But
then a strange thing happened! I was suddenly
overwhelmed with confusion and sank back beside
my companion, pulling her parasol well over my face.
"Was it so dreadful?" I implored. "I'm afraid it
was," said she. "Hide your fan from the others.
We will never tell." Presently she added, thoughtfully,
"I wonder what your Aunt Mary would say?"
I did not wonder. I knew perfectly well what my
Aunt Mary would say.
</p>

<p>
All of which goes to prove that it was lucky my
husband had not taken his wife to Greece, and had
not accepted the mission to Persia which was offered
him. He had a wife, unfortunately, who might on
provocation lose her head.
</p>

<p>
The next morning we repaired to the White
House to help receive the Japanese Embassy. Mr.
Buchanan would have done well to select his guests
with regard to their slimness. The East Room was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64' href='#Page_64'>64</a></span>
packed. Ranging on either side according to our
rank, the Congressmen found themselves near the
wall. We mounted our smallest representative, Mr.
Boyce, on the low mantelpiece behind some palms
with instructions to peep and tell us everything he
saw. "What are they doing now, Mr. Boyce?"
"Oh, it's grand! They bow, and then they bow
again!" "Well, what are they saying? What are
they doing now?" "They are still bowing, and
'old Buck,' God bless him, is bowing too." The
ceremony was long. The murmured voices were
low. One might have imagined one's self at a
funeral.
</p>

<p>
The Belgian Baron de Limbourg gave a fine garden
party to the strangers. The Baron considered
himself on the entertainment committee as he had
recently married the daughter of our Secretary of
State, Mr. Cass. There were large grounds around
his residence, and these he lighted with Japanese
lanterns, dotting the lawn all over with pretty tents,
in which young girls costumed to represent the
peasants of various countries served ices and confections.
The large area in the rear was converted by
carpets, hangings, and divans into a luxurious Turkish
smoking den.
</p>

<p>
The Japanese always presented a pretty work-box,
filled with curious silks, to the ladies who entertained
them. They would then range themselves on the
seats prepared for them and look on silently, with
half-shut eyes and expressionless faces. The dancing
delighted them. "How much are the women
paid?" ventured one, and was amazed to find they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65' href='#Page_65'>65</a></span>
danced for pleasure only. A tiny, round-faced boy
was always of the party. We sometimes spoke to
him, and he invariably answered "all right," until
he was known as "Little All Right," and, as he
was the only gracious one of the whole party, he
became a favorite.
</p>

<p>
The Prince de Joinville attended Madame de
Limbourg's fÃªte. During the afternoon our host
sent for me, and I was conducted to an alcove where
the Prince, Miss Lane, Lord Lyons, and some of the
Cabinet ladies were gathered around a little bottle of
wine, which was, we were told, old, old Rose wineâ€”costing
so much that now, what with interest and
compound interest, every drop was worthâ€”I forget
how much! And we were to drink Miss Lane's
health. "And I!"â€”she protested. "I cannot
drink my own health! Am I to have no wine?"
Whereupon she was conjured to think her own toastâ€”and
we would, not knowing her thought, drink
it with her.
</p>

<p>
It was supposed that Lord Lyons was her suitor,
and we were persuaded that the President desired
her to marry him. But nobody knows the heart of
the king, nor the heart of the President (who fills
in some sort a king's position), still less the heart of
the President's pretty nieceâ€”least of all the heart
of a wily diplomat! We only know she married
one of her own countrymenâ€”and as to Lord
Lyons, we lost him for good and all when the dreadful
war came.

<h2>
CHAPTER V
<br />
<span class="s05">GAY SOCIAL LIFE IN WASHINGTON</span>
</h2>

<p>
The rolls of the Supreme Court, Senate, and
House of Representatives presented a
list of great names in 1854-1860. It
would seem that our country, knowing herself to
be in mortal danger, had summoned the wisest of
her sons for conference and council: Rufus Choate,
Curtis, Seward, Douglas, Jefferson Davis, Salmon
Chase, Sumner, Hale, Toombs, Hunter, Robert J.
Walker, and the brilliant men of the lower House;
all these were present at the great consultation.
</p>

<p>
Of these men the most interesting, picturesque,
and prominent was undoubtedly Stephen A.
Douglas. His political career is known to a world
which is still divided in opinion of him. Was his
fevered life the result of patriotism, or of personal
ambition? The world still assumes the power to
read, with a magnifying glass, the inner workings of
the human mechanism, and to put its discerning
finger on the spring of human actions. Who has
ever seen the heart of another? Who knows his
own? By their works ye shall know them, not
by their impulses, not by their struggles with the
diverse machinery within them.
</p>

<p>
One who liked not Stephen A. Douglas has thus
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67' href='#Page_67'>67</a></span>
described him. "Erect, compact, aggressive. A
personage truly to be questioned timidly, to be
approached advisedly. Here indeed was a lion, by
the very look of him master of himself and of others.
By reason of its regularity and masculine strength, a
handsome face. A man of the world to the cut of
the coat across the broad shoulders. Here was one
to lift a youngster into the realm of emulation, like a
character in a play, to arouse dreams of Washington
and its Senators and great men. For this was one
to be consulted by the great alone. A figure of
dignity and power with the magnetism to compel
moods. Since, when he smiled you warmed in spite
of yourself, and when he frowned the world looked
grave."
</p>

<p>
This was Stephen A. Douglas. The picture is a
true one. What wonder that he should have
captivated my husband and myself, scarcely more
than half his age? The warmest friendship grew
up between us.
</p>

<p>
I remember well my own first interview with him
in Washington. At a crowded ball, I had found a
chair outside the crush, when he approached with a
bottle of champagne and a glass in his hands. "I
need no introduction, Madam," he said. "I am
sure you cannot have forgotten the man who met
you a few years ago in the little Petersburg hotel
and told you how like you are to the Empress
EugÃ©nie. No? I thought not," laughed the judge,
"and yet she isn't a priming to our own women!
Now," he added, bending down and speaking
gravely, "I shall send Mrs. Douglas to see you. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68' href='#Page_68'>68</a></span>
wish you to be friends. Not pasteboard friends,
with only a bit of cardboard passing between you
now and then, but real good friends, meeting often
and being much together." Just here, as he poised
his bottle to fill my glass, his elbow was jostled, and
down came the foaming champagne, over my neck
and shoulders and the front of my dress. The
friendship was christenedâ€”the bottle broken on
the new ship! "Don't worry about the gown!
You have excuse now to buy another," said the
judge, as I gasped when the icy flood ran down my
bosom.
</p>

<p>
He had lately married his second wife, the belle
of Washington, beautiful Adele Cutts; tall, stately,
and fair exceedingly. She was a great-niece of Dolley
Madison. We met often, and it came to pass that
"the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of
David."
</p>

<p>
She did not impress one as having what we call
"depth of character," what is commonly implied in the
term "superior," not a woman to assume to lead
and teach other womenâ€”a character less lovable
often than the woman who knows herself to be of
like weaknesses with ourselves. But she was beautiful
as a pearl, sunny-tempered, unselfish, warmhearted,
unaffected, sincere. She was very attentive
to her "little giant." When he made those terribly
long speeches in the Senate, on the Lecompton
Constitution, on the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, on
popular sovereignty, she would wait in the gallery
and hurry down to wrap his overcoat around him,
as he stood in the hall dripping with perspiration.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69' href='#Page_69'>69</a></span>
She imbibed enough political lingo to rally and
amuse him. Some workmen having arrived to
erect a platform in his ball room for musicians, she
exclaimed: "Oh, Judge Douglas! What is a
platform? They are going to bring one into this
house, and we shall be flayed alive or murdered in
our beds!"
</p>

<p>
I said to her once: "You know you are not really
handsomer than the rest of us! Why do people
say so?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I never trick myself out in diamonds,
or have more than one color in a gown. An artist
told me once that all those things spoiled a picture."
</p>

<p>
She would have liked the diamonds as well as the
rest of us, and once said so to her husband. "Oh,
no!" he answered, "diamonds are the consolation
of old wives, a diamond for a wrinkle!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas was the first of the Washington
ladies who adopted the fashion of closing her
shutters in the early afternoon and lighting her
rooms with gas. She was delighted as a child with
the effect and indulged in a preliminary waltz with
me before the company arrived. "O dear!" she
exclaimed, suddenly, "what am I to do with this
<i>awful</i> picture of Judge Douglas's? I daren't take it
away because he bought it for his first wife; and
when old Mrs. Martin pounces down upon us to
see how we are spending her grandchildren's money,
she will miss it, and think I've sold it! But isn't it
<i>awful</i>? Do spread out your flounces in front of it
as well as you can." The noonday lighting of her
rooms was a great success. Lord Lyons looked up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>70</a></span>
and spoke of the beauty of the starlit night, adding
"and there's a fine moon out of doors." John G.
Saxe was one of the guestsâ€”and his merry hostess
introduced him as "deserving capital punishment
for making people laugh themselves to death."
</p>

<p>
I have had occasion to allude so often to the
costumes of the ladies of Mr. Buchanan's administration,
that I have resolved boldly to ask my reader
to accompany me for a few minutes to Vanity Fair,
as, guided by society reports of the period, I
describe the dresses worn by the leaders of fashion.
I suppose the journals of our day would not print
columns on columns describing the gowns worn at
balls, unless there were some sure to read. Costume
has always interested the world. It is still a question
whether costume influences character, or <i><span lang="la">vice versa</span></i>.
And yet one regrets to treat charming women as
though they were lay figures.
</p>

<p>
There will be a great deal of sorrowful record in
this book. Let us linger awhile on the flowery
brink, before we reach the time when the noise of
angry waters will be too loud to be hushed by the
frou-frou of a lady's silken gown. Moreover, there
are always mistakes and misconceptions to be corrected
and set right. Have I not just read in a
New York daily paper of the ugly fashions of the
Washington of the times just before the warâ€”the
"great hoops, gowns of reps, the hideous tints of
red, the Congress gaiters; how nobody wore a ball
gown costing more than $55," etc., etc.? The Congress
gaiters must be acknowledged, the hoops also,
but perhaps they may all come again; and then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71' href='#Page_71'>71</a></span>
some beauty like the empress of the French may
arise to make them beautiful. They <i>were</i> large!
Beside them Queen Elizabeth's farthingale was an
insignificant circumstance. The belle in the fifties
lived in an expansive time. There was still plenty
of room in the world. Houses were broad and low,
carriages were broad and low, furniture was massive.
Even a small pier glass was broadened by great
scrolls of mahogany. Drawing-rooms were filled
with vast arm-chairs, sofas, and tables. The legs
of pianos were made as massive as possible.
</p>

<p>
Ladies wore enormous hoops, and because their
heads looked like small handles to huge bells, they
widened the coiffure into broad bandeaux and braids,
loaded it with garlands of flowers, and enlarged it by
means of a wide head-dress of tulle, lace, and feathers,
or crowned it with a coal-scuttle bonnet tied under
the chin with wide ribbons. In this guise they
sailed fearlessly about, with no danger of jostling a
neighbor or overturning the furniture. They had
not then filled their rooms with spider-legged chairs
and tables, nor crowded the latter with frail toys and
china. Now that so many of these things are imported,
now that the world is so full of people,â€”in
the streets, cars, theatres, at receptions,â€”milady
has found she must reef her sails. Breadth was the
ambition of 1854â€”length and slimness the supreme
attainment of 1904. What would the modern belle
look like, among all these skyscrapers, in a hoop?
Like a ballâ€”nothing more.
</p>

<p>
Finding herself with all this amplitude, milady of
the fifties essayed gorgeous decoration. She had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72' href='#Page_72'>72</a></span>
stretched a large canvas; she now covered it with
picturesâ€”bouquets and baskets of flowers appeared
on the woollens for house dresses; on the fine gauzes
and silks one might find excellent representations
of the Lake of Geneva, with a distant view of the
Swiss mountains.
</p>

<p>
When a lady ordered a costume for a ball, her
flowers arrived in a box larger than the glazed boxes
of to-day in which modistes send home our gowns.
The garniture included a wreath for the hair, with
bunches at the back from which depended trailing
vines. The <i><span lang="fr_FR">bouquet de corsage</span></i> sometimes extended
to each shoulder. Bouquets were fastened on gloves
at the wrist, wreaths trailed down the skirt, wreaths
looped the double skirt in festoons. Only one kind
of flower was considered in good taste. Milady
must look like a basket of shaded roses, or lilies, or
pomegranates, or violets. Ropes of wax beads were
sometimes substituted for flowers.
</p>

<p>
I once entered a milliner's shopâ€”not my dear
Madame Delarue'sâ€”and in the centre of the room,
suspended by a wire from the ceiling, was one of
these huge garnituresâ€”all tied together and descending
down to the floor. "This, Madame," I
said, "is something very <i><span lang="fr_FR">recherchÃ©</span></i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Madame! That is the rarest parure I
have. There was never one like it. There will
never be another."
</p>

<p>
I scrutinized the flowers, and found nothing
remarkable in any way.
</p>

<p>
"That, Madame," continued the milliner, "was
purchased from me by the wife of Senator â€”â€”!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73' href='#Page_73'>73</a></span>
She wore it to Mrs. Gwin's ball, and returned it to
me next day. I ask no pay! I keep it for the
sake of Mrs. Senator â€”â€”, that I may have the
honor of exhibiting it to my patrons."
</p>

<p>
There is no reason, because we sometimes choose
to swing back into the ghastly close-fitted skirt, or
to wrap ourselves like a Tanagra figurine, that we
should despise a more spacious time. Nor is it at
all beneath us to attach enough importance to dress
to describe it. Witness the recent "Costumes of
Two Centuries," by one of our most accomplished
writers. Witness the teachings of a theologian
eighteen hundred or more years ago, who condescended
to illustrate his sermon by women's ways
with dress! Says Tertullian: "Let simplicity be
your white, charity your vermilion; dress your
eyebrows with modesty, and your lips with reservedness.
Let instruction be your ear-rings, and a
ruby cross the front pin in your head; submission
to your husband your best ornament. Employ
your hands in housewifely duties, and keep your
feet within your own doors. Let your garments be
of the silk of probity, the fine linen of sanctity, and
the purple of chastity."
</p>

<p>
"How does that impress you for a nineteenth-century
costume?" I asked Agnes my bosom
friend, to whom I read the passage aloud. "Well,"
she replied, "I should be perfectly willing to try
the ruby hairpin as a beginningâ€”and get Clagett
to order the new brand of silk, which sounds as if it
might be a very pure article indeed and warranted to
wear well; but if you are seeking my honest opinion
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74' href='#Page_74'>74</a></span>
of Tertullian, I frankly confess that I think our
clothes and our behavior to our husbands are none
of his business."
</p>

<p>
Society letters of 1857 give us strictly accurate
description of toilettes, which may interest some of
my readers:<a name='FA_3' id='FA_3' href='#FN_3' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a>â€”
</p>

<p>
"The wealth of the present Cabinet, and their
elegant style of living, sets the pace for Washington
soirÃ©esâ€”equal in magnificence to the gorgeous
fÃªtes of Versailles.
</p>

<p>
"At the Postmaster-General's the regal ball room
was lined with superb mirrors from floor to ceiling.
In the drawing-rooms opposite the host, hostess,
and daughter and Miss Nerissa Saunders occupied
the post of receiving.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Brown was dressed in rose-colored brocade,
with an exquisite resemblance of white lace
stamped in white velvet, a point lace cape, and turban
set with diamonds. Miss Brown wore a white
silk tissue embroidered in moss rosebuds, a circlet
of pearls on her hair, and natural flowers on her
bosom. Lady Napier wore white brocaded satin,
with head-dress of scarlet honeysuckle. Madame
de Sartige's gown was of white embroidered crÃªpe,
garnished with sprays of green. The wife of
Senator Slidell was costumed in black velvet,
trimmed with fur. Her head-dress was of crimson
velvet, rich lace, and ostrich feathers. A superb
bandeau of pearls bound her raven hair. Miss
Nerissa Saunders was exquisite in a white silk,
veiled with tulle, the skirts trimmed with rose-colored
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75' href='#Page_75'>75</a></span>
quilling. Mrs. Senator Clay wore canary
satin, covered all over with gorgeous point lace.
Mrs. John J. Crittenden was superb in blue moire
antique, with point lace trimmings. Mrs. General
McQueen of South Carolina appeared in a white silk
with cherry trimmings, her head-dress of large pearls
fit for a queen. Mrs. Senator Gwin wore superb
crimson moire antique with point lace, and a head-dress
of feathers fastened with large diamonds.
Mrs. Stephen A. Douglas, a white tulle dress over
white silkâ€”the overdress looped with bunches of
violets and grass, similar bunches on breast and
shoulder, and trailing in her low coiffure. Mrs.
Faulkner from Virginia was attired in blue silk
and Mechlin lace, her daughters in white illusion.
Mrs. Reverdy Johnson was superb in lemon satin
and velvet pansies. Mrs. Pringle of Charleston
wore a velvet robe of lemon color; Mrs. Judge
Roosevelt of New York velvet and diamonds;
Mrs. Senator Pugh of Ohio crimson velvet with
ornaments of rubies and crimson pomegranate
flowers."
</p>

<p>
This last lady, Mrs. Pugh, wife of the Senator
from Ohio, was <i><span lang="fr_FR">par excellence</span></i> the beauty of the
day. To see her in this dress was enough to "bid
the rash gazer wipe his eye." Her eyes were
large, dark, and most expressive. Her hair was
dark, her coloring vivid. Mrs. Douglas, Mrs.
Pugh, and Kate Chase were the three unapproached,
unapproachable, beauties of the Buchanan administration.
The daughter of Senator Chase was really
too young to go to balls. She was extremely beautiful,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76' href='#Page_76'>76</a></span>
"her complexion was marvellously delicate,
her fine features seeming to be cut from fine bisque,
her eyes, bright, soft, sweet, were of exquisite blue,
and her hair a wonderful color like the ripe corn-tassel
in full sunlight. Her teeth were perfect.
Poets sang then, and still sing, of the turn of her
beautiful neck and the regal carriage of her head."
She was as intellectual as she was beautiful. From
her teens she had been initiated into political questions
for which her genius and her calm, thoughtful
nature eminently fitted her. When she realized
that neither party would nominate her father for
President in 1860, she turned her energetic mind to
the formation of plans and intrigues to obtain for
him the nomination of 1868! She failed in that,
she failed in everything, poor girl. She wrecked
her life by a marriage with a wealthy, uncongenial
governor of Rhode Island, from whom she fled
with swift feet across the lawn of the beautiful home
at Canonchet, and hand in hand with poverty and
sorrow ended her life in obscurity.
</p>

<p>
It is going to be a long time before we again visit
Vanity Fair; and lest it linger too delightfully in
our memories, we must try to find some rift in the
lute, some fly in the amberâ€”not daring, however,
to look beneath the surface.
</p>

<p>
And so we are fain to acknowledge that the evening
gowns of these fair dames were liberal only in
their skirts. The bodice was <i><span lang="fr_FR">dÃ©colletÃ©</span></i> to the extremest
limitâ€”as I suppose it will always be. And
then, as now,â€”as always,â€”there was no lack of wise
men, usually youthful prophets, to preach against
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77' href='#Page_77'>77</a></span>
it, to read for our instruction Solomon's disrespectful
allusions to jewels in the ears of fair women
without discretion, and St. Paul's well-known remarks
upon our foibles. "The idea of quoting
Solomon as an authority on women," said my
friend Agnes one day, as we walked from church.
"I <i>never</i> quote Solomon! He knew a good many
women without discretion, some hundreds of them;
but he didn't live up to his convictions, and he
changed his mind very often. He was to my thinking
not at all a nice person to know."
</p>

<p>
"But how about St. Paul?" I ventured.
</p>

<p>
"I consider it very small in St. Paul to think
so much about dress anyway! One would suppose
the thorn in his own flesh would have made
him tender toward others; and Timothy must have
been a poor creature to be taken in by 'braided hair,'
'gold and pearls, and costly array.' Now, of course,
we have a few of those things, and like to wear our
hair neatly; but I don't see why they are not suitable
for us so long as we don't live for them, nor seek to
entangle Timothy."
</p>

<p>
"Well," I replied, "I never can feel it is at all
my affair. I hear it often enough! But somehow
St. Simeon Stylites, preaching away on his pillar,
seems a great way off, and not to know the bearings
of all he talks about. We listen to him dutifully;
but I fancy if we amend our ways we will do it of
our own selves, and not because of St. Simeon."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't mind St. Simeon," said my irate friend
(she had worked herself up to a pitch of indignation);
"probably he was old and venerable, and to be tolerated;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78' href='#Page_78'>78</a></span>
but it hurts me to be preached to by a young
thing like that minister to-day, as if I were a Babylonish
woman! We don't 'walk haughtily with
stretched-forth necks, walking and mincing as we
go, making a tinkling with our feet.' And as to
our 'changeable suits of apparel,' and the 'crimping
pins,' do we live for these things? Our maids
make a living by taking care of them while we are
at church hoping to hear of something better than
crimping pins."
</p>

<p>
The lady who expressed these heretical sentiments
was, as I have remarked, my most intimate friend;
and although not older than herself, I considered it
my duty to reason with her. "But you see, my
dear Agnes," I said, "we are obliged to be on the
side of our young preacher, whether we like it or
not. He is the white-plumed champion riding forth
from the courts of purity and beauty of behavior.
We wouldn't like to be the sable knight who
emerges from the opposite direction."
</p>

<p>
"I would!" declared my young rebel. "Infantile
clergymen should keep to the sins of their own
sex. Nobody criticises men's dress. They are exempt.
They may surround their countenances with
Henry VIII ruffs, which make them look like the
head of John the Baptist on a charger,â€”nobody
calls them ridiculous. They wear the briefest surf
costumesâ€”nobody says they are indecent."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dearâ€”"
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear, I know all about the matter of
evening dress. I've studied it up. It is a time-honored
fashion (I can show you all about it in my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79' href='#Page_79'>79</a></span>
new encyclopÃ¦dia). You remember I let you air
your learning and quote old Tertullian. Did I look
bored?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all. You may tell me now. You can
finish before we get home."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, the <i><span lang="fr_FR">dÃ©colletÃ©</span></i> bodice is not a new
expression of total depravity. It is an old fashion,
appearing in 1280, with stomacher of jewels. It
reached England from Bohemia, but was then the
fashion in Italy, Poland, and Spain. Those times
were not conspicuous for sentiment, but were quite
as moral as the times of the Greek chiton, or the
Roman tunic, or the Norman robe, or the Saxon
gown."
</p>

<p>
"But," I interrupted, "it was out of fashion in
the high-necked days of Queen Elizabeth."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she had her own reasons for disliking to
see a suggestive bare throat! Queen Bess was not
conspicuous for purity. Don't interrupt meâ€”I'll
prove everything by the bookâ€”lots of good women
have worn low dresses. Madame Recamier was a
pretty good woman, and so were our grandmothers,
and so were the ladies of the Golden Age in Virginia
who reared the boys that won our independence."
</p>

<p>
"All of which proves nothing," I declared; but
we had reached our door on New York Avenue, and
went in for our Sunday dinner. My friend did not
inflict the encyclopÃ¦dia. She had already quoted
it. What was the use? We may be sure of one
thing: no fashion has ever yet been discarded because
it was abused. No Damascus blade has ever
been keen enough to lop off an offending fashion.

CHAPTER VI
<br />
<span class="s05">CHARACTERISTICS OF SOCIAL LIFE IN 1858â€”LEADERS
IN SOCIETY</span>
</h2>

<p>
There were many brilliant and beautiful
women who escaped the notice of the society
newsmonger of the day.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Cyrus McCormick, recently married to the
inventor of the great reaping machine, was one of
these. Mr. McCormick, then a young man, was
destined to be decorated by many European governments
and to achieve a great fortune. His
wife, just out of Miss Emma Willard's school,
was very beautiful, very gentle, and winning. No
sheaves garnered by her husband's famous reaper
can compare with the sheaves from her own sowing,
during a long life devoted to good deeds.
</p>

<p>
Then there were Mrs. Yulee, wife of the Senator
from Florida, and her sisters, Mrs. Merrick and
Mrs. Holt, all three noted for personal and intellectual
charm; and beautiful Mrs. Robert J. Walker,
who was perhaps the first of the coterie to be called
to make a sacrifice for her country, exchanging the
brilliant life in Washington for the hardships of
Kansasâ€”"bleeding Kansas," torn with dissensions
among its "squatter sovereigns," and with a climate
of stern severity, where food froze at night and
must be broken with a hatchet for breakfast. Mrs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81' href='#Page_81'>81</a></span>
Walker shrank from the ordeal, for she was well
fitted for gay society; but the President himself
visited her and begged the sacrifice for the good of
the country. She went, and bore her trials. They
were only a little in advance of sterner trials ordained
for some of her Washington friends. Nor
must we fail to acknowledge the social influence of
Mrs. Jefferson Davis, one of the most brilliant
women of her timeâ€”greatly sought by cultivated
men and women.

<p>
But the wittiest and brightest of them all was
Mrs. Clay, the wife of the Senator from Alabama.
She was extremely clever, the soul of every company.
A costume ball at which she personated
Mrs. Partington is still remembered in Washington.
Mrs. Partington's sayings could not be arranged
beforehand and conned for the occasion. Her malapropos
replies must be improvised on the moment,
and must moreover be seasoned with wit to redeem
them from commonplace dulness. Mrs. Clay rose
to the occasion, and her Mrs. Partington became
the Mrs. Partington of the future.
</p>

<p>
The reader will not fail to observe the number
of Southern women who were prominent in Mr.
Buchanan's court. A correspondent of a leading
New York paper<a name='FA_4' id='FA_4' href='#FN_4' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> has recently written an interesting
article on this subject. He declares that the
Southern women (before Lincoln's day) had long
controlled the society of Washington. "With their
natural and acquired graces, with their inherited
taste and ability in social affairs, it was natural that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82' href='#Page_82'>82</a></span>
the reins should fall to them. They represented
a clique of aristocracy; they were recognized leaders
who could afford to smile good-naturedly at the
awkward and perplexed attempts of the women
from the other sectionsâ€”Mrs. Senator This, Mrs.
Congressman Thatâ€”to thread the ins and outs
of Washington's social labyrinth. To none of
these ladies was the thought pleasant of secession
from the Union and consequent giving up whatever
of social dominion she had acquired."
</p>

<p>
I wish I could give some idea of the "days at
home" of these court ladies in Washington in 1858.
The large public functions were all alike then as
now, with this exception, that nearly every man
present was Somebody, and every woman Somebody's
wife. It was not necessary for these people
to talk. The men made little effort. It was well
known what they had said yesterday in the House
or the Senate Chamber; but we dared not express
opinions in public (and not freely in private),
such was the tense feeling at that time. Conversation
had been always, at the South, an art carefully
cultivated. Conversation suffered at a time when
we were forced to ignore subjects that possessed us
with absorbing interest and to confine ourselves to
trivialities.
</p>

<p>
Excusing the silence of one famous man, somebody
remarked: "Oh, well, you know brilliant men
do not of necessity talk well. Thrilled by their
utterances in their speeches and writings, we are
surprised, when we meet them, at their silence."
A "famous man's" eye twinkled. "Ask Galt,"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83' href='#Page_83'>83</a></span>
he said, "why he doesn't give away his gems.
Probably he might answer that he proposes to sell
them," an ingenious way of avoiding the remotest
hint that silence was the result of preoccupied
thought on the grave questions of the hour.
</p>

<p>
For some inexplicable reason the wives of great
men are apt to be quiet and non-committalâ€”little
moons revolving around a great luminary. Moon-like,
one side only is turned to the world. How
is it on the other side? We have a glimpse of it
over the <i><span lang="fr_FR">demi-tasse</span></i> in the drawing-room after dinner,
or at our informal "at homes" in our own
houses.
</p>

<p>
At these times of unbending in Washington we
were wont to begin in a rather stilted manner, sipping
our coffee and liqueurs in a leisurely way, and
steering widely clear of politics and politicians. We
talked of art and artists, galleries in Europe, shops
in Paris,â€”anything except what we were all thinking
about. The art of conversation suffered under
such circumstances. But some interesting books
were just out in England, and everybody was discussing
them. Thackeray had recently given "The
Virginians" to the world. Tennyson was turning
all the girls' heads with "Elaine." A new star
was risingâ€”George Eliot. Dickens, we were, at
the moment, cordially hating because of his "American
Notes." Bulwer was well to the fore. Two
valued members of our own special coterie were
Randolph Rogers and Thomas Crawford the sculptor,
whose genius, differently expressed, lives to-day
in his gifted son, Marion Crawford. Thomas
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84' href='#Page_84'>84</a></span>
Crawford had been commissioned by the state of
Virginia to execute a colossal statue of Washington
for the Capitol Square in Richmond, a great work,â€”including
statues of Virginia's statesmen,â€”which
was happily completed in 1861, and from which I
heard Jefferson Davis's inaugural address, February 22,
1862, upon his taking the oath as permanent President
of the Confederacy. It was a black day of
rain and snow; the new government, destined never
to flourish in sunshine, was born in storm and
tempest.
</p>

<p>
Thomas Crawford, born in New York in 1814,
was now at the height of his fame. He had studied
and worked with Thorwaldsen. Apart from his
peculiar genius he was a charming companion, full
of versatile talk. The younger man, Randolph
Rogers, was also most interesting. He brought to
us his sketches and drawings for the bronze doors
of the Capitol before they were submitted to the
committee, and came again when they were accepted,
to tell us of his good fortune.
</p>

<p>
The army and navy people were especially interesting.
They never discussed politics. Their positions
were assured and there were consequently no
feverish society strugglers among them. They had
no vulgar respect for wealth, entertaining charmingly
within their means. Admiral Porter and his family
were there, General Winfield Scott was there, the
admiral (then commander) forty-four years old, and
the noble old veteran nearer seventy-four. Both
were delightful members of Washington society.
Nobody esteemed wealth or spoke of it or thought
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85' href='#Page_85'>85</a></span>
of it. Office, position, talent, beauty, and charm
were the requisites for men and women.
</p>

<p>
On one day, I remember, I had gone the rounds
of Cabinet receptions, had taken my chocolate from
the generous urn of the Secretary of State, and
had dutifully looked in upon all the other Secretaries.
I knew a dear little lady, foreign, attached
to one of the legations (I really never knew whether
she was Russian or Hungarian), who had invited
me for the "end of the afternoon." Her husband
had not a prominent place in the embassy, nor she
in society, but she knew how to gather around her
tea-kettle a choice little company, every one of whom
felt honored to be included. I found her seated at
a small round table, and she welcomed me in the
English that gained from a musical voice, and the
deliberate enunciation of syllable which always seems
to me so complimentary and respectful in foreigners.
</p>

<p>
The fashion of the low tea-table had just been
introduced. One could have tea, nothing else.
One could always find behind the silver urns "'igh
and 'aughty" butlers serving chocolate, wine, and
every conceivable dainty at the houses of the great
Senators, Ministers, and Cabinet officers. Things
were much more <i><span lang="fr_FR">distinguÃ©</span></i> at this lady's tea-table.
A few early spring flowers, crocuses, hyacinths, or
purple heather, were blooming here and there about
the room. Our hostess was gowned in some white
stuff, and there was a bit of classic suggestion in
her attire, in the jewelled girdle, and an order or
medal tucked under a ribbon. A little white-capped
maid welcomed and ushered us, and managed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86' href='#Page_86'>86</a></span>
to hover about for all the service we were
likely to require. The impression grew upon me
that all this had been done for me especially, and I
found myself thinking how fortunate it was I had
happened to come. That lovely woman would have
been so sorely disappointed had I stayed away!
</p>

<p>
But presently other guests arrived. They were
all foreigners, but perceiving the American presence
they spoke only English. The hostess put into
motion the most musical conversation. How has
she done it? She has made no effort "to entertain."
Conversation had come unbidden. Russian tea?
Why, certainly! Do we ever care for other than
Russian tea? She was deliberate. We forgot we
were sorely pressed this day with seventeen names
on our list. We gave ourselves up to the pleasure
of observing her.
</p>

<p>
She lighted her silver lamp; and, although she
wished us to see the great shining samovar which
descended to her from her grandmother, she said it
was good, very good indeed, in the camp or on
journeys when one had only charcoal; but here in
America the fairy lamp to light the wax taper and
the alcohol burner beneath the kettle are best. She
poured the water, which had bubbled, but not boiled
(boiling water would make the tea flat), over delicious
tea, paused a moment only, then poured the
steaming amber upon two lumps of sugar, two slices
of lemon, and one teaspoonful of rum, and we pronounced
it a perfect cup of tea. But our enchantress
said No, that some day ladies will grow tea in
their own conservatories, and then only will it be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87' href='#Page_87'>87</a></span>
perfect in this country; for the ocean voyage spoils
the delicacy of the sensitive herb.
</p>

<p>
Glancing around the table, our hostess grasped
the situation. Here was a Russian lady with a
proud head, there two dark-eyed Bohemians, one
Greek beauty, an English woman, and our own stiff,
heavy, uncompromising American self!
</p>

<p>
She is to make these people happy for the five
minutes they are around her little board. How
does it come to pass that these strangers find a
common ground upon which they can hold animated
conversation?
</p>

<p>
They talked of genius and geniuses,â€”how they
are not created by opportunity or culture, but are
inspired; how that, apart from their gifts, they
are quite like other people, not even cleverer always.
"Yes," said the Greek girl, with an exalted look in
her dark eyes, "they are chosen, like the prophets,
to speak great words or compose immortal music, or
build symphonies in stone; and what they do is
outside themselves altogether." "It is literally
true," said the Englishwoman, "that people have 'a
gift' apart from their ordinary selves. Does not
George Eliot say that his novels grow in him like a
plant. No amount of work and study can create
a genius!" And then everybody marvels at the
wonderful young man (for nobody knows it is a
woman) who has just written "Adam Bede" and
"The Mill on the Floss."
</p>

<p>
Or perhaps the hostess has bribed some one of the
foreign legation to come to her "at home." Novels
on Washington life hint of such a possibility. Or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88' href='#Page_88'>88</a></span>
perhaps some prince of good talkers among our own
Ministers is home for a brief holiday, or returned
from a mission, and a circle gathers around him.
</p>

<p>
Our Minister, sent to France by Mr. Pierce, once
honored me by his presence and told us the following
story. Everybody who remembers the genial
John Y. Mason will easily imagine how he told it,
and how his own magnetism possessed his listeners.
Not a tea-cup rattled during the narration. "I
lived," said Mr. Mason, "at a hotel for a few
weeks after receiving my appointment as Minister
Plenipotentiaryâ€”while my house was being made
ready to bring my family. The house was crowded,
and my landlord was forced to divide one of his
offices by a thin partition to receive me at all.
</p>

<p>
"One night I was awakened by a stifled sob on
the other side of the partition. Rising on my
elbow, I listened. The sob was repeatedâ€”then
I heard abusive language and oaths in Englishâ€”I
fancied I heard a blow! Leaping to my feet, I
struck smartly on the partition, and all was still.
</p>

<p>
"The next morning I asked the clerk about my
neighbors and complained that they disturbed me.
He shrugged his shoulders and said, '<span lang="fr_FR">Mais, Monsieur!</span>
they are Americans!' as if that explained
everything. However, he informed me that they
had left the hotel that morning.
</p>

<p>
"A few days later I was sitting in my room at the
legation, when I received a visitorâ€”a slender female
closely veiled, who said in a troubled whisper that
she had come to claim protection of the French
government. I told her I could not confer with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89' href='#Page_89'>89</a></span>
her while she was disguised, and she slowly raised
her hand and held her veil aside. I never saw a
lovelier face.
</p>

<p>
"She could not have been older than eighteen
years. Her features were delicate, her eyes large and
expressive, her brow shaded by golden-brown hair.
She was deathly white. I never saw such pallor.
'What can I do for you, my child?' I asked. Well,
it was a sad story. Married to a dissipated young
fellow, away on her wedding journey; threatened,
and in terror of losing her life. She wished the
protection of the police. She said she should never
have had the courage to ask it alone, but that she
knew I had slept near her at the Maison DorÃ©e. I
had heard! I could understand. I was the American
Minister, and I could help.
</p>

<p>
"'But think,' I said, 'I heard nothing but harsh
language. We cannot go with this to the <i><span lang="fr_FR">prÃ©fet</span></i>.
He will not consider it cause for action against your
husband.'
</p>

<p>
"The girl hesitated. Finally, with a burst of
tears, she unfastened her gown at the throat, turned
it down, and disclosed the dark print of fingers on
the delicate skin.
</p>

<p>
"It was enough. She had been choked into
silenceâ€”this frail American girlâ€”on the night
when I heard the smothered sob.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you may imagine my zeal in her
behalf. I had daughters of my own. I arranged
to accompany the young wife at once to the office
of the <i><span lang="fr_FR">prÃ©fet</span></i>, and having ascertained the address of
her bankers I resolved to make arrangements to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90' href='#Page_90'>90</a></span>
get her out of Paris in case she felt her life to be
in danger.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I waited long at the office of the <i><span lang="fr_FR">prÃ©fet</span></i>.
Finally our turn came. I rose and made my statement.
Imagine my feelings when my fair client
threw back her veil, and with a surprised look said:
</p>

<p>
"'I think the American Minister has been dreaming!'
</p>

<p>
"I felt as if a tub of ice-water had been poured
over me. Of course my position was perfectly
ridiculous. Before I could recover she had slipped
through the crowd and was gone. While we waited
she had changed her mind!"
</p>

<p>
"The wretch!" exclaimed one of the listeners.
"That just proves that women are always attracted
by brutality."
</p>

<p>
"Really?" said Mr. Mason.
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly, perhaps, but there was once an
English countess who explained a divorce suit of one
of her relatives thus:â€”
</p>

<p>
"'You see, Ermentrude was one of those women
who needed kicking down the stairs, and Ferdinand
was gentle; he was not up to it!'"
</p>

<p>
An agreeable function, no longer in vogue in this
country, was the evening party. Lady Napier gave
one of these parties to present her friends to Edward
Everett.
</p>

<p>
These parties were arranged that pleasant people
might meet distinguished strangers and each other.
As this was the prime object of these occasions,
there were no blatant bands to make conversation
impossible, but there was no lack of delightful music.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91' href='#Page_91'>91</a></span>
Miss Nerissa Saunders played exquisitely upon the
harp; Mrs. Gales's niece, Juliana May, sang divinely;
many young ladies had cultivated voices.
Nobody thought of hiring entertainment for guests.
The guests were bright talkers and could entertain
each other. If a ball room were attached to the
<i><span lang="fr_FR">salon</span></i>, dancing was expected; but the parlors were
distant and people could talk! Of course it is always
stupid to collect a lot of dull people together,
but the wives of the brilliant men of Mr. Buchanan's
administration understood entertaining. There were
always gifted conversationalists present who liked
talking better than eating, with cleverness enough
to draw out, and not forestall, the wit of others.
This art could not be claimed by the great talkers
of old English society, Johnson, Macaulay, Coleridge,
De Quincey, and the rest. We should not now,
I am sure, care much for these monopolists. Sheridan,
for instance, must have been rather a quenching
element at an evening party; for in addition to his
own witty creations, he had a trick of preserving the
bon mots of others, leading conversation into channels
where they would fit in, and using them accordingly.
Thus in talking with Sheridan his friends
had a dozen wits to cope with withal.
</p>

<p>
Our Washington hostesses always gave a supperâ€”not
a fine supperâ€”a <i>good</i> supper, where the old
family receipt book had been consulted, especially
if our hostess had come from Kentucky, Maryland,
or Virginia. The canvasback ducks, terrapin, and
oysters were unlike Gautier's. We all know that
rubies are now less rare in this country than good
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92' href='#Page_92'>92</a></span>
cooks. We may essay the triumphs of the old
Washington of the fifties, but beneath our own fig
tree they become failures and shabby makeshifts.
There are mysteries in cooking unattainable to any
but the electâ€”and of the elect were the sable
priestesses of the Washington kitchens.

<h2>
CHAPTER VII
<br />
<span class="s05">THE THIRTY-SIXTH CONGRESS</span>
</h2>

<p>
When the famous Thirty-sixth Congress
met for its long session, December 5,
1859, the whole country was in ferment
over the execution of John Brown. "An indiscreet
move in any direction," wrote ex-President Tyler
from his plantation, "may produce results deeply
to be deplored. I fear the debates in Congress,
and above all the Speaker's election. If excitement
prevails in Congress, it will add fuel to the flame
which already burns so terrifically."<a name='FA_5' id='FA_5' href='#FN_5' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> He, and all
patriots, might well have been afraid of increased
excitement. It was evident from the first hour
that the atmosphere was heavily charged. The
House resolved itself into a great debating society,
in which the only questions were: "Is slavery right
or wrong? Shall it, or shall it not, be allowed in
the territories?" The foray of the zealot and
fanatic aggravated the fury of the combatants.
</p>

<p>
The member from Mississippiâ€”L. Q. C. Lamar
(afterwards Supreme Court Justice of the United
States)â€”threw an early firebrand by announcing
on the floor of the House, "The Republicans are
not guiltless of the blood of John Brown, his co-conspirators,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94' href='#Page_94'>94</a></span>
and the innocent victims of his ruthless
vengeance." Lawrence Keitt of South Carolina
declared: "The South asks nothing but its rights.
I would have no more, but as God is my judge, I
would shatter this republic from turret to foundation-stone
before I would take a tittle less." Thaddeus
Stevens of Pennsylvania retorted: "I do not
blame gentlemen of the South for using this threat
of rending God's creation from foundation to turret.
They have tried it fifty times, and fifty times
they have found weak and recreant tremblers in the
North who have been affected by it, and who have
acted from those intimidations." Such were a few,
by comparison with those that rapidly followed,
of the wild utterances of the hour. This occurred
on the second day of the session. The House was
in an uproar! Members from their seats crowded
down into the aisles, and the clerk was powerless to
preserve order. "A few more such scenes," said
one, "and we shall hear the crack of the revolver
and see the gleam of brandished blade."
</p>

<p>
In this spirit Congress proceeded to ballot for its
Speaker, and balloted for two months (until February
1), before Mr. Sherman was abandoned (having
withdrawn his name) and a compromise effected by
the election of Mr. Pennington, who represented
neither extreme of party.
</p>

<p>
During these two months everything was said
that could be said to fan the flame. Hot disputes
were accentuated by bitter personal remarks. One
day a pistol accidentally fell from the pocket of a
member from New York, and, thinking it had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95' href='#Page_95'>95</a></span>
been drawn with the intention of using it, some of
the members were wild with passion, crying excitedly
for the sergeant-at-arms, and turning the
House into a pandemonium. John Sherman, who
had been the unlucky bone of contention, made this
remarkable statement: "When I came here I did
not believe that the slavery question would come
up; and but for the unfortunate affair of Brown at
Harper's Ferry I do not believe that there would
have been any feeling on the subject. Northern
men came here with kindly feelings, no man approving
the foray of John Brown, and every man willing
to say so, every man willing to admit it as an act of
lawless violence."
</p>

<p>
Four years before this stormy election, Banks had
been chosen Speaker after a contest longer by a few
days than this. Then, as now, slavery was the point
at issue; but "good humor and courtesy had marked
the previous contest where now were acrimony and
defiance.... Then threats of disunion were received
with laughter; now they were too manifestly
sincere to be treated lightly." In four years the
breach between North and South, once only a rift
in the rock, had become a yawning chasm. What
might it not become in four years more?
</p>

<p>
Not foreseeing the rapid change of public sentiment,
the Democrats had, four years before, selected
Charleston for the meeting of the convention to
name their candidate for the presidency. Accordingly,
on April 23, the party was convened in the
"hotbed of disunion."
</p>

<p>
The Northern Democrats had heard much of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96' href='#Page_96'>96</a></span>
splendor and elegance in which Charlestonians lived,
and of the Arabian hospitality of the South, which
could ignore all animosities over the bread and salt.
But Charleston turned a cold shoulder to its guests
from the North. All hearts, however, and all homes
were opened to the Southerners. They dined with
the aristocrats, drove with richly dressed ladies in gay
equipages, and were entertained generally with lavish
hospitality. All this tended to widen the breach
between the sections.
</p>

<p>
When the delegates left their fair entertainers for
the sessions of the convention, the ladies repaired to
old St. Michael's Episcopal Church, where prayers,
specially ordered for the success and prosperity of
the South, were daily offered. "At the same time
fervent abolition preachers at the North were praying
for a disruption of the Charleston convention."
</p>

<p>
Judge Douglas had written a platform that was
not acceptable to the South. After its adoption
seven delegates from Southern states declared their
purpose of secession. The convention, seeing that
it was impossible to reach any result, adjourned
May 3, to meet at Baltimore the 18th of June. The
seceders resolved to meet at Richmond the second
Monday of May. This initial movement awakened
the alarm of at least one devoted son of the South.
Alexander Stephens wrote to a friend: "The leaders
intended from the beginning to rule or ruin....
Envy, hate, jealousy, spiteâ€”these made war in
heaven, which made devils of angels, and the same
passions will make devils of men. The Secession
movement was instigated by nothing but bad passions.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97' href='#Page_97'>97</a></span>
Patriotism, in my opinion, had no more to
do with it than love of God had with the other
revolt."<a name='FA_6' id='FA_6' href='#FN_6' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> In conversation with his friend Johnston,
shortly after the adjournment of the Convention,
Stephens said, "Men will be cutting one another's
throats in a little while. In less than twelve months
we shall be in a war, and that the bloodiest in history.
Men seem to be utterly blinded to the future."<a name='FA_7' id='FA_7' href='#FN_7' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a>
</p>

<p>
The nomination of Lincoln and Hamlin on a
purely sectional platform aroused such excitement
all over the land, that the Senate and House of
Representatives gave themselves entirely to speeches
on the state of the country. Read at this late day,
many of them appear to be the high utterances of
patriots, pleading with each other for forbearance.
Others exhausted the vocabulary of coarse vituperation.
"Nigger thief," "slave driver," were not
uncommon words. Others still, although less unrefined,
were not less abusive. Newspapers no longer
reported a speech as calm, convincing, logical, or
eloquent,â€”these were tame expressions. The terms
now in use were: "a torrent of scathing denunciation,"
"withering sarcasm," "crushing invective,"
the orator's eyes, the while, "blazing with scorn and
indignation." Young members ignored the salutation
of old Senators. Mr. Seward's smile after such
a rebuff was maddening! No opportunity for scornful
allusion was lost. My husband was probably
the first Congressman to wear "the gray," a suit of
domestic cloth having been presented to him by his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98' href='#Page_98'>98</a></span>
constituents. Immediately a Northern member said,
in an address on the state of the country, "Virginia,
instead of clothing herself in sheep's wool, had better
don her appropriate garb of sackcloth and ashes."
In pathetic contrast to these scenes were the rosy,
cherubic little pages, in white blouses and cambric
collars, who flitted to and fro, bearing, with smiling
faces, dynamic notes and messages from one Representative
to another. They represented the future
which these gentlemen were engaged in wreckingâ€”for
many of these boys were sons of Southern widows,
who even now, under the most genial skies, led lives
of anxiety and struggle. Thoroughly alarmed, the
women of Washington thronged the galleries of the
House and the Senate Chamber. From morning
until the hour of adjournment we would sit, spellbound,
as one after another drew the lurid picture
of disunion and war.
</p>

<p>
Our social lines were now strictly drawn between
North and South. Names were dropped from
visiting lists, occasions avoided on which we might
expect to meet members of the party antagonistic
to our own. My friend Mrs. Douglas espoused
all her husband's quarrels and distinctly "cut" his
opponents. There were very few boxes to be
had at our little theatreâ€”and the three best were
usually secured by Mrs. Douglas, Miss Harriet
Lane, and Mrs. John R. Thompson. The feud
between the President and Judge Douglas was
bitter, and Mrs. Douglas never appeared at Miss
Lane's receptions in the winter of 1859-1860. One
evening we were all in our theatre boxes, Miss Lane
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99' href='#Page_99'>99</a></span>
next to us, and I the guest of Mrs. Douglas. Mr.
Porcher Miles, member from South Carolina, who
had opposed Judge Douglas's nomination, appeared
at the door of our box. Instantly Mrs. Douglas
turned and said, "Sir, you have made a mistake.
Your visit is intended for next door!" "Madam,"
said Mr. Miles, "I presumed I might be permitted
to make my respects to Mrs. Pryor, for whom my
call was intended." I had the benefit, of course, of
the private opinions of each, and was able to be
the friend of each. "This, I suppose, is Southern
chivalry," said my fair friend. "It savors, I think,
of ill-bred impertinence." "I had supposed her a
lady," said Mr. Miles, "or at least a woman of the
world. She behaved like a rusticâ€”an <i><span lang="fr_FR">ingÃ©nue</span></i>."
</p>

<p>
I could but receive their confidences in silence,
perfectly well knowing that both were in the wrong.
Both were betrayed by the mad passions of the hourâ€”passions
which caused older heads to misunderstand,
mislead, and misbehave! "I am the most
unpopular man in the country," said Judge Douglas
(one of the presidential candidates); "I could walk
from Boston to Chicago by the light of my own
burning effigies,â€”and I guess you all know how
much Virginia loves me."
</p>

<p>
I had the good fortune to retain some of my
Northern friends. The family of the Secretary of
State was loyal to me to the end. When my husband
was once embroiled in a violent quarrel, growing
out of sectional feeling, General Cass sent his
granddaughter, pretty Lizzie Ledyard (my prime
favorite), with his love to bid me "take heart," that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100' href='#Page_100'>100</a></span>
"all would turn out right." Mrs. Douglas never
abated one jot of her gentle kindness, although she
knew we belonged to a party adverse to her husband.
Mrs. Horace Clark's little brown ponies stopped
as often as ever at my door to secure me for a drive
down the avenue and a seat beside her in the House.
She had been a Miss Vanderbilt and was now wife
of a member from New York. All of them were
prompt to congratulate me upon my husband's
speech on "the state of the country," and to praise it
with generous words as "calm, free from vituperation,
eloquent in pleading for peace and forbearance."
</p>

<p>
The evening after this speech was delivered, we
were sitting in the library on the first floor of our
home, when there was a ring at the door-bell. The
servants were in a distant part of the house, and such
was our excited state that I ran to the door and answered
the bell myself. It was snowing fast, a carriage
stood at the door, and out of it bundled a mass
of shawls and woollen scarfs. On entering, a manservant
commenced unwinding the bundle, which
proved to be the Secretary of State, General Cass!
We knew not what to think. He was seventy-seven
years old. Every night at nine o'clock it was the
custom of his daughter, Mrs. Canfield, to wrap him
in flannels and put him to bed. What had brought
him out at midnight? As soon as he entered, before
sitting down, he exclaimed: "Mr. Pryor, I have been
hearing about secession for a long timeâ€”and I would
not listen. But now I am frightened, sir, I am
frightened! Your speech in the House to-day gives
me some hope. Mr. Pryor! I crossed the Ohio
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101' href='#Page_101'>101</a></span>
when I was sixteen years old with but a pittance in
my pocket, and this glorious Union has made me
what I am. I have risen from my bed, sir, to implore
you to do what you can to avert the disasters
which threaten our country with ruin."
</p>

<p>
Never was a spring more delightful than that of
1860. The Marine Band played every Saturday
in the President's grounds, and thither the whole
world repaired, to walk, or to sit in open carriages,
and talk of everything except politics. Easy compliments
to the ladies fell from the lips of the men
who could apply to each other in debate abuse too
painful to remember. Sometimes we would be invited
for the afternoon to sit on the veranda of the
White Houseâ€”and who could fail to mark the
ravages of anxiety and care upon the face of the President!
All the more because he insistently repeated
that he was never betterâ€”that he slept finely and
enjoyed the best health. Nevertheless, if one
chanced to stand silently near him in a quiet corner,
he might be heard to mutter, "Not in my timeâ€”not
in my time." Not in his time let this dear
Union be severed, this dear country be drowned in
blood.
</p>

<p>
On other afternoons we visited Mr. and Mrs.
Robert E. Lee at Arlington, or drove out to Georgetown
through the fragrant avenue of blossoming
crab-apples, or to Mrs. Gales's delightful house for
tea, returning in the soft moonlight. Everybody
in Washington dined early. Congress usually
adjourned at four o'clock, and my little boys were
wont to be on the roof of our house, to watch for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102' href='#Page_102'>102</a></span>
the falling of the flag over the House of Representatives,
the signal that we might soon have dinner.
The evening meal was late, usually handed. It was
considered not "stylish" to serve it at a table. A
servant would enter the drawing-room about eight
o'clock, with a tray holding plates and little doilies.
Another would bring in buttered biscuits and
chipped beef or ham, and a third tray held cups of
tea and coffee. Some delicate sweet would follow.
Little tables of Chinese lacquer were placed between
two or more ladies, and lucky was the man who
would be invited to share one of them. Otherwise
he must improvise a rest for his plate on his trembling
knees. "Take care! Your plate will fall,"
I said to one. "Fall! I wish it wouldâ€”and
<i>break</i>! The only thing that worries me is when
the blamed thing takes to rolling. Why, I have
chased plates all around the room until I thought
they were bewitched or held the secret of perpetual
motion!" These suppers were very conversational,
and one did not mind their being so light. There
would be punch and sandwiches at eleven.
</p>

<p>
Such were the pleasant happenings that filled our
daysâ€”clouded now by the perils which we could
not ignore after the warnings to which we listened at
the Capitol. We were conscious of this always in
our round of visits, receptions, dinners, and balls,
with the light persiflage and compliments still in
our ears.
</p>

<p>
But when late evening came, the golden hour of
reunion in the library on the first floor of our home
was marked by graver talk. There would assemble
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103' href='#Page_103'>103</a></span>
R. M. T. Hunter, Muscoe Garnett, Porcher Miles,
L. Q. C. Lamar, Boyce, Barksdale of Mississippi,
Keitt of South Carolina, with perhaps some visitors
from the South. Then Susan would light her fires
and show us the kind of oysters that could please
her "own white folks," and James would bring in
lemons and hot water with some choice brand of old
Kentucky.
</p>

<p>
These were not convivial gatherings. These men
held troubled consultations on the state of the countryâ€”the
real meaning and intent of the North, the
half-trusted scheme of Judge Douglas to allow the
territories to settle for themselves the vexed question
of slavery within their borders, the right of peaceable
secession. The dawn would find them again and
again with but one conclusionâ€”they would stand together:
"<span lang="la">Unum et commune periclum una salus</span>!"
</p>

<p>
But Holbein's spectre was already behind the
door, and had marked his men! In a few months
the swift bullet for one enthusiast, for another
(the least considered of them all), a glorious death
on the walls of a hard-won rampartâ€”he the first
to raise his colors and the shout of victory; for
only one, or two, or three, the doubtful boon of existence
after the struggle was all over; for <i>all</i> survivors,
memories that made the next four years seem
to be the sum of lifeâ€”the only real lifeâ€”beside
which the coming years would be but a troubled
dream.
</p>

<p>
The long session did not close until June, and in
the preceding month Abraham Lincoln was chosen
candidate by the Republican party for the presidency,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104' href='#Page_104'>104</a></span>
and Stephen A. Douglas by the Democrats. The
South had also a candidate, and hoping to make
things better, the ruffled-shirt gentryâ€”the Old-Line
Whigsâ€”had also named their man.
</p>

<p>
My little boys and I were glad to go home to
Virginia. A season of perfect happiness awaited
them, with their sisters and the dear old people
whom they called grandfather and grandmother.
Under the shade of the trees, and in the veranda
covered with Lamarque roses, who could dream of
war?
</p>

<p>
In the hot and bitter campaign that ensued we
are told that "Douglas took the <i>unusual course</i>
for a presidential candidate of visiting different parts
of the country and discussing the political issues and
their personal bearings. Speaking on all occasions,
from the platform of the railroad car, the balcony
of the hotel, at monster mass-meetings, he said much
that was trivial and undignified, but he also said much
that was patriotic, unselfish, and pregnant with constitutional
wisdom. Coldly received at the South,
where he was looked upon as a renegade, he aroused
great enthusiasm at the North, and his personal
presence was the only feature that gave any life to
the struggle against the Republicans."<a name='FA_8' id='FA_8' href='#FN_8' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a>
</p>

<p>
The words "irrepressible conflict" were much in
evidence during this campaign. Seward adopted
them, and made speeches characterized as his "Irrepressible
Conflict Speeches."<a name='FA_9' id='FA_9' href='#FN_9' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> Seward reaffirmed
almost everywhere the declaration of the "irrepressible
conflict," and when challenged because of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105' href='#Page_105'>105</a></span>
term, he "maintained that the Republicans simply
reverted to the theory and practice of their fathers,"
giving no hint of a quotation.
</p>

<p>
The authorship of these words has always been
credited to Mr. Seward. Their true origin may be
found in the address of Mr. Lincoln, delivered at
Cincinnati, Ohio, in September, 1859. On page
262 of the volume published by Follett, Foster, &amp;
Co. in 1860, entitled "Political Debates between
Hon. Abraham Lincoln and Hon. Stephen A.
Douglas," may be found the following extract from
Mr. Lincoln's speech:â€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I have alluded in the beginning of these remarks to the
fact that Judge Douglas has made great complaint of my
having expressed the opinion that this Government 'cannot
endure permanently half slave and half free.' He has
complained of Seward for using different language, and
declaring that there is an 'irrepressible conflict' between
the principles of free and slave labor. [A voice: 'He says
it is not original with Seward. That is original with Lincoln.']
I will attend to that immediately, sir. Since that
time, Hickman of Pennsylvania expressed the same sentiment.
He has never denounced Mr. Hickman; why?
There is a little chance, notwithstanding that opinion in
the mouth of Hickman, that he may yet be a Douglas man.
That is the difference! It is not unpatriotic to hold that
opinion, if a man is a Douglas man.
</p>

<p>
"But neither I, nor Seward, nor Hickman is entitled to
the enviable or unenviable distinction of having first expressed
that idea. That same idea was expressed by the
<i>Richmond Enquirer</i> in Virginia, in 1856, quite two years before
it was expressed by the first of us. And while Douglas was
pluming himself that in his conflict with my humble self, last
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106' href='#Page_106'>106</a></span>
year, he had 'squelched out' that fatal heresy, as he delighted
to call it, and had suggested that if he only had had
a chance to be in New York and meet Seward he would
have 'squelched' it there also, it never occurred to him to
breathe a word against Pryor. I don't think that you can
discover that Douglas ever talked of going to Virginia to
'squelch' out that idea there. No. More than that.
That same Roger A. Pryor was brought to Washington
City and made the editor of the <i><span lang="fr_FR">par excellence</span></i> Douglas
paper, after making use of that expression, which in us is
so unpatriotic and heretical."
</p>
</div>

<p>
Before we returned to Washington Mr. Lincoln
was elected President of the United States.

<h2>
CHAPTER VIII
<br />
<span class="s05">MEMORABLE DAYS IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY</span>
</h2>

<p>
A momentous day in the history of this
country was November 6, 1860â€”on that
day the extreme party of the North elected
its candidate, with a Vice-President, making the
Executive purely sectional. But few people expected
the fulfilment of the evils so insistently
threatened as a consequence of this election.
</p>

<p>
Not for one moment had we seriously entertained
the thought of secession. The question of slavery
in the territories was still unsettled, and the stormy
scenes in the House might possibly be reÃ«nacted.
Like General Cass, we had heard all our lives rumors
of possible secession, possible war. Nobody believed
these rumorsâ€”any more than we believed that every
threatening cloud would burst in a devastating tempest.
It was part of the routine, "the order of the
day," to enliven things by warm discussions and
spicy personalities.
</p>

<p>
My husband had been unanimously reÃ«lected,
and our delightful Washington life was assured to
usâ€”certainly for three wintersâ€”probably for all
time.
</p>

<p>
We were so deeply concerned about the state of
the country at large, that his election excited us but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108' href='#Page_108'>108</a></span>
little. When the polls closed at sunset, one
of his political friends came to me and said there
would be a torch-light procession in his honor,
that the crowd would call at his residence, and
the house must be illuminated. "Illuminated!"
I exclaimed. "Impossible! There are not half a
dozen candles in the house, and the stores are all
closed. Besides, the babies will be asleep. It
is bad for babies to be roused from their first
sleep."
</p>

<p>
My friend seemed to appreciate this reasoning;
but later in the evening I received a bushel of small
white turnips and a box of candles, with a pencilled
note saying that I must cut holes in the vegetables,
and I would find them admirable candlesticks. The
little boys and servants went to work with a will,
and when the drum announced the near approach
of the procession, every window was blazing with a
double row of lights, one row on the window-sill,
the other midway, on the top of the lower sash.
</p>

<p>
My young Congressman was considered a brilliant
speaker, and his talents were sometimes called
into use in Washington. Some matter of municipal
interest was supported by him, and another torch-light
procession gathered late one night around the
door of the house on New York Avenue.
</p>

<p>
"You are not to listen," he said to me, as he
descended to the front door to speak to the crowd;
"I shall say a few words only." I threw a shawl
over my night-dress and crouched down in a little
balcony just over his head. To my prejudiced
mind, his speech was the most graceful and charming
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109' href='#Page_109'>109</a></span>
thing I had ever heard. I was in a delightful
trance of happiness when he closed, and was rudely
awakened when, in response to shouts of "Go on, go
on, we could listen all night," the daring young
orator deliberately turned and pointed to the balcony
above him: "Go on, my friends? Go on, exposed
to the criticism of one from whose criticism I am
always trying to escape?"
</p>

<p>
I fell back out of sight on the floor. I never
listened afterward!
</p>

<p>
And among the pleasant happenings of these
golden days, so soon to be shut in by darkness and
sorrow, was the presentation to my young Congressman
of a beautiful service of silver from his Democratic
friends of Virginia in recognition of "brilliant
talents, eminent worth, and distinguished services."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Galt made this splendid service, and I
record it here because it became part of the history
of the next years of trouble. I should have lost it
once (in a dark hour), but Mr. Galt bade me keep
itâ€”that brighter days were in store for me and
mine, a prophecy which he lived to see fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
We were all in our places in November, setting
our houses in order, several weeks before the
assembling of Congress. We were warmly welcomed
into our pleasant home by Susan, whose
authority, now fully established and recognized,
kept us in perfect order. Everything promised
a season of unusual interest. We now knew everybodyâ€”and
what is more I, for one, liked everybody.
It takes so little to make a woman happy!
</p>

<p>
In Washington our social life did not begin
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110' href='#Page_110'>110</a></span>
before New Year's Day. Among our first cards
this winter was an invitation to the marriage of
Mr. Bouligny, member from Louisiana, and Miss
Parker, daughter of a wealthy Washington grocer.
Rumors reached us of unusual plans for this wedding.
Mr. Parker's large house was to be converted
into a conservatory filled with blossoming roses
and lilies. Fountains were to be introduced, new
effects in lighting. The presents were to be magnificent,
the bridal dress gorgeous.
</p>

<p>
Upon arriving at the house (I think it was an
afternoon wedding) I found the President seated in
an arm-chair at one end of the drawing-room, and
the guests ranging themselves on either side. A
crimson velvet curtain was stretched across the other
end of the room. Presently the curtain parted, and
the bridal tableau appeared in position behind it.
After the ceremony the crowd waited until the
President went forward to wish the bride and her
husband "a great deal of happiness." Everybody
remained standing until Mr. Buchanan returned to
his seat. I stood behind his chair and observed that
he had aged much since the summer.
</p>

<p>
He had had much to bear. Unable to please
either party, he had been accused of cowardice,
imbecility, and even insanity, by both parties.
"The President is pale with fear," said General
Cass. "He divides his time equally between praying
and crying. Such an imbecile was never seen
before," said another. A double-leaded editorial in
the <i>New York Tribune</i> of December 17 suggested
that he might be insane. On the day of the wedding,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111' href='#Page_111'>111</a></span>
December 20, he stoutly denied that he was
ill. "I never enjoyed better health nor a more tranquil
spirit," said the hard-pressed President. "I
have not lost an hour's sleep nor a single meal. I
weigh well and prayerfully what course I ought to
adopt," he had written on that day.
</p>

<p>
The crowd in the Parker drawing-room soon
thinned as the guests found their way to the rooms
in which the presents were displayed. The President
kept his seat, and I stood behind him as one
and another came forward to greet him. Presently
he looked over his shoulder and said, "Madam, do
you suppose the house is on fire? I hear an unusual
commotion in the hall."
</p>

<p>
"I will inquire the cause, Mr. President," I said.
I went out at the nearest door, and there in the
entrance hall I found Mr. Lawrence Keitt, member
from South Carolina, leaping in the air, shaking a
paper over his head, and exclaiming, "Thank God!
Oh, thank God!" I took hold of him and said:
"Mr. Keitt, are you crazy? The President hears
you, and wants to know what's the matter."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" he cried, "South Carolina has seceded!
Here's the telegram. I feel like a boy let out from
school."
</p>

<p>
I returned and, bending over Mr. Buchanan's
chair, said in a low voice: "It appears, Mr. President,
that South Carolina has seceded from the
Union. Mr. Keitt has a telegram." He looked
at me, stunned for a moment. Falling back and
grasping the arms of his chair, he whispered,
"Madam, might I beg you to have my carriage
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112' href='#Page_112'>112</a></span>
called?" I met his secretary and sent him in
without explanation, and myself saw that his carriage
was at the door before I reÃ«ntered the room. I
then found my husband, who was already cornered
with Mr. Keitt, and we called our own carriage and
drove to Judge Douglas's. There was no more
thought of bride, bridegroom, wedding cake, or
wedding breakfast.
</p>

<p>
This was the tremendous event which was to
change all our livesâ€”to give us poverty for riches,
mutilation and wounds for strength and health,
obscurity and degradation for honor and distinction,
exile and loneliness for inherited homes and friends,
pain and death for happiness and life.
</p>

<p>
The news was not known, except in official circles,
until the evening. The night was dark. A drizzling
rain was falling; the streets were almost impassable
from mud.
</p>

<p>
At the house of a prominent South Carolina gentleman
a crowd soon collected. The street was full
of carriages, the house brilliantly lighted.
</p>

<p>
Admiral Porter, then a lieutenant, had heard the
startling news, and called at this house to tell it.
He found the mistress of the mansion descending
in cloak and bonnet, and as soon as she saw him she
exclaimed: "Oh, Captain, you are just the man I
want. I'm going to the White House to tell the
President some good news. The horses are sick
and I'm going to walk over."<a name='FA_10' id='FA_10' href='#FN_10' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a>
</p>

<p>
"It is impossible for you to walk through the
rain and mud," said the Lieutenant. "There are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113' href='#Page_113'>113</a></span>
ten or twelve hacks at the door, and I will press
one into your service." So saying, he called a carriage
and helped her to enter it, getting in after her.
</p>

<p>
"I was under the impression," he said, as they
started, "that you were having a party at your
house, it was so brilliantly lighted up, and I thought
I would venture in uninvited."
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed," she replied; "but we have received
glorious news from the South, and my husband's
friends are calling to congratulate him. South Carolina
has seceded, and, oh, Captain, we will have a
glorious monarchy, and you must join us."
</p>

<p>
"And be made Duke of Benedict Arnold?"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" she exclaimed, "we will make
you an admiral."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," said Lieutenant Porter, "Admiral
of the Blue. For I should feel blue enough to see
everything turned upside down, and our boasted
liberty and civilization whistled down the wind."
</p>

<p>
"What would you have?" she inquired.
"Would you have us tamely submit to all the indignities
the North puts upon us, and place our
necks under their feet? Why, this very day my
blood boiled while I was in Congress, and I could
scarcely contain myself. An old black Republican
was berating the Southern people as if they were a
pack of naughty children. However, Mr. Rhett
took the floor and gave the man such a castigation
that he slunk away and was no more heard from."
</p>

<p>
Just then they reached the White House.
"Come in," said the lady, "and hear me tell the
President the good news."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114' href='#Page_114'>114</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Porter preferred returning to her
house. There he found a crowd around a generous
bowl of punch. When he had an opportunity, he
asked the host if he thought it possible the Southern
states would secede. "What more do they
want?" he inquired. "They have a majority in
the Senate and the House, and, with the Supreme
Court on their side, they could make laws to suit
themselves."
</p>

<p>
"True," his host replied, "most people would be
satisfied with that. 'Better to bear the ills we have
than fly to others that we know not of.' But <i>you</i>
will join us? <i>You must!</i> We will have a navy to
be proud of, and we'll make you admiral."
</p>

<p>
"There's one comfort," said an old society dame
who now joined the party. "South Carolina is a
fickle young thing and may change her mind! She
declared herself ready once before to walk out,â€”you
all remember it,â€”and changed her mind. She
took off her things and concluded to stay a little
longer."
</p>

<p>
"She has gone for good and all this time, depend
upon it," said the host. "She was only giving
warning then! Her time is up now and she is off."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the lady of the house was telling the
President news that was no news to him. He was
fully prepared to receive it calmly and gravely. I
had preceded her by some hours.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Porter little dreamed of the good fortune
the secession of South Carolina would bring
to him. From a poor lieutenant with anxious cares
about a large family, he was speedily raised by Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115' href='#Page_115'>115</a></span>
Lincoln to the proud position of rear-admiral of
the United States.
</p>

<p>
His own comment upon the enthusiasm of his
Southern friends is amusing. He declared that if
the capital and its surroundings had been less
stupid, that if those vivacious Southerners could
have had a court, theatres, and opera-houses, the
catastrophe which overwhelmed North and South
might have been prevented. "The Romans
understood these things better than we. They
omitted nothing to keep the people amused; they
even had the street fountains at times run with wine,
and the investment was worth the money spent."
"But what," said Admiral Porter, "could one expect
at a court presided over by an old bachelor
whose heart was dead to poetry and love; who sat
at dinner with no flowers to grace the festive board,
and never even had a <i><span lang="fr_FR">boutonniÃ¨re</span></i> on his coat
lapel?" which was one way, at least, of accounting
for things.
</p>

<p>
Of course, we all paid our respects to the President
on the next New Year's Day, and joined the
motley crowd of men and women of every degree
who were admitted after the starred and beribboned
dignitaries from foreign lands had been received.
"Here I am, Mr. President," said one of the
witty Southern women, "and my cook will be
here in a few minutes! I left her dressing to
come."
</p>

<p>
The day that ushered in the eventful year 1861
was gloomy out of doors, but within the Executive
Mansion flowers, music, gay attire, and bright smiles
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116' href='#Page_116'>116</a></span>
ruled the hour. "I wish you a happy New Year,
Mr. President," fell from every lip, but in every
heart there was a gloomy foreboding of impending
disaster. What would the year bring to the "wayward
sister," whose sons had all gone home? How
we missed them!â€”Mr. Porcher Miles, Mr. Boyce,
Mr. and Mrs. Keitt, always so delightful a part
of our Washington social life. Some of us might
expect to return; but this was adieu, not <i><span lang="fr_FR">au revoir</span></i>,
to our President. This was his last New Year's
Day in the White House, not his last day of
perplexity and trouble. Very soon more wayward
sisters would depart, and the hour he had dreaded
would "come in his time."
</p>

<p>
There is no time at the President's New Year's
reception to gather in corners for private talk. We
must hurry on our rounds to the houses of the
Cabinet and of the foreign Ministers. Sending the
gentlemen of our party forward to visit the Senators'
wives, we hastened home to our own punch-bowl.
</p>

<p>
I brewed a mighty bowl that last New Year's
Day. Dr. Garnett and Judge Scarborough presided
over the mixing, to be sure that the arrack
was proportioned rightly, and that there were just as
many and no more toasted crab-apples than there
should be. I was assisted by my friend Agnes,
whom I love to quote, and whose full name I
should like to give, except for the reason that she
is now living, and, being a respectable lady of the
old school, is averse from seeing her name in print.
In the society journal occasionally, apropos of the
opera or reception, perhaps, but in a book! I
should never be forgiven.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117' href='#Page_117'>117</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Late in the afternoon my rooms were throngedâ€”with
Virginians and Southerners mainly, but with
some Northern friends as well, for Virginia was not
yet classed. Like Touchstone, I was "in a parlous
state," lest some of my guests who had already honored
many punch-bowls should venture on forbidden
subjects. More than one came in on the arm of
James, but it took a better man than James to conduct
him out again and into his carriage. My
friend who had distinguished himself at my first
President's dinner was in high feather, as were some
grave judges I knew.
</p>

<p>
There was but one thought in every mind, gay
or sober. "Is this a meeting of the Girondists?"
queried one.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"When shall we three meet again?"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
quoted another.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"When the hurly-burly's doneâ€”</p>
<p>When the battle's lost and won,"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
was the prompt answer. "Sh-h-h!" said an old
army officer. "It is not lucky to talk of lost battles
on New Year's Day, nor of Girondists' feasts on the
eve of a revolution."
</p>

<p>
The season which was always ushered in on New
Year's Day resolved itself literally this year into a
residence in the galleries of the Senate Chamber and
the House of Representatives.
</p>

<p>
Before the 2d of February, Mississippi, Florida,
Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas had dissolved
their bonds with the Federal Union. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118' href='#Page_118'>118</a></span>
farewell addresses of the Representatives of the seceded
states became the regular order of the day.
Jefferson Davis's final farewell closed with these
solemn words: "May God have us in His holy
keeping, and grant that, before it is too late, peaceful
counsels may prevail."
</p>

<p>
Virginia, had she retained her original colonial
bounds, could have dictated to the rest. Now,
should she elect to join the Southern Confederacy,
the states she had given to the Unionâ€”her own
childrenâ€”would be arrayed against her.
</p>

<p>
Virginia now essayed to arbitrate. Her Peace
Commission met in Washington, but without result,
except that it was for her a fleeting moment of
enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kellogg of Illinois said: "She has thrown
herself into the breach to turn aside the tide of disunion
and revolution, and she says to the nation, 'Be
united and be brothers again.' God bless the Old
Dominion!" Said Mr. Bigler of Pennsylvania, January
21: "Pennsylvania will <i>never</i> become the enemy
of Virginia! Pennsylvania will never draw the
sword on Virginia."
</p>

<p>
Apprehension was felt lest the new President's
inaugural might be the occasion of rioting, if not
of violence. We were advised to send our women
and children out of the city. Hastily packing my
personal and household belongings to be sent after
me, I took my little boys, with their faithful nurse,
Eliza Page, on board the steamer to Acquia Creek,
and, standing on deck as long as I could see the
dome of the Capitol, commenced my journey homeward.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>119</a></span>
My husband remained behind, and kept his
seat in Congress until Mr. Lincoln's inauguration.
He described that mournful day to meâ€”differing
so widely from the happy installation of Mr. Pierce.
"O'er all there hung a shadow and a fear." Every
one was oppressed by it, and no one more than the
doomed President himself.
</p>

<p>
We were reunited a few weeks afterward at our
father's house in Petersburg; and in a short time
my young Congressman had become my young
colonelâ€”and Congressman as well, for as soon
as Virginia seceded he was elected to the Provisional
Congress of the Confederate States of America, and
was commissioned colonel by Governor Letcher.
</p>

<p>
I am afraid the evening is at hand, when we must
bid adieu to the bright daysâ€”the balls, the merry
hair-dresser, the round of visits, the levees, the charming
"at homes." The setting sun of such a day
should pillow itself on golden clouds, bright harbingers
of a morning of beauty and happiness.
Alas, alas! "whom the gods destroy they first
infatuate."

<h2>
CHAPTER IX
<br />
<span class="s05">RAPID PROGRESS OF EVENTS AT THE SOUTH</span>
</h2>

<p>
When it was disclosed that a majority of
the Virginia Convention opposed taking
the state out of the Union, the secessionists
became greatly alarmed; for they knew that
without the border states, of which Virginia was the
leader, the cotton states would be speedily crushed.
They were positively certain, however, that, in the
event of actual hostilities, Virginia would unite with
her Southern associates. Accordingly, it was determined
to bring a popular pressure to bear upon the
government at Montgomery to make an assault
on Fort Sumter. To that end my husband went
to Charleston, and delivered to an immense and
enthusiastic audience, a most impassioned and vehement
speech, urging the Southern troops to "strike
a blow," and assuring them that in case of conflict,
Virginia would secede "within an hour by Shrewsbury
clock." The blow was struck; Mr. Lincoln
called upon Virginia for a quota of troops to subdue
the rebellion, and the state immediately passed an
ordinance of secession.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pryor, with other gentlemen, was deputed by
General Beauregard to demand the surrender of the
fort, and in case of the refusal which he foresaw,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121' href='#Page_121'>121</a></span>
to direct the commandant of battery, Johnson, to
open fire. When the order was delivered to the
commandant, he invited my husband to fire the first
shot; but this honor my husband declined, and instead
suggested the venerable Edmund Ruffin, an
intense secessionist, for that service. It was the
prevalent impression at the time, that Mr. Ruffin
did "fire the first gun"; at all events he fired, to
him, the last; for on hearing of Lee's surrender,
Cato-like, he destroyed himself.
</p>

<p>
I have often wondered what would have been the
effect upon the fortunes of our own family, had my
husband fired the shot that ushered in the war.
Even had his life been spared, he certainly would
not have become an eminent lawyer in the state of
New York and a justice of its Supreme Court.
</p>

<p>
Fort Sumter was reduced on April 12, and
Virginia was in a wild state of excitement and confusion.
</p>

<p>
The deputation sent to Washington in the interests
of peace had failed in its mission. The
Convention of 1861 was in session at Richmond
as early as April 11â€”sitting with closed doors.
The people were wrought to the highest pitch of
anxiety lest the conservative spirit of the older men
should triumph and should lead them to prefer submission,
which would mean dishonor, to secession,
which could mean nothing worse than death.
</p>

<p>
Business was practically suspended in Richmond
and Petersburg; men crowded the streets to learn
the latest news from the North, and were inflamed
by reports of the arrest and incarceration in Fort
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122' href='#Page_122'>122</a></span>
Lafayette of Southern sympathizers. As crowds
gathered in different localities the advocates of secession
addressed them in impassioned speeches which
met with hearty response from the people.
</p>

<p>
On April 16, a body, calling itself the Spontaneous
People's Convention, met and organized in
the Metropolitan Hall at Richmond. The door
was kept by a guard with a drawn sword in his
hand. David Chalmers of Halifax County was
president, and Willoughby Newton, vice-president.
</p>

<p>
Patrick Henry Aylett, grandson of Patrick Henry,
made a noble speech, urging moderation and delay;
warmer speeches followed. A Southern flag was
raised on the capitol amid shouts of applause, but at
midnight the governor had it removed, for the
convention had not yet passed the ordinance of
secession, and those who rose with the dawn of the
next eventful day found the state flag calmly floating
in its place.
</p>

<p>
I was a guest of the government house at this
time, and in the calm and seclusion of Mrs. Letcher's
rooms I missed much of the excitement. She was
a motherly, domestic woman, who chose to ignore
outside disturbances for the sake of present peace.
We talked together of family matters, as we sewed
upon little gowns and pinafores, indulged in reminiscences
of the Washington life which we had enjoyed
together, and said very little of the troubles
of the hour. Mrs. Letcher thought the political
storm must pass. It was hard to bear; the governor
was nervous and sleeping badly, but quiet
would surely come, and when it didâ€”why, then,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123' href='#Page_123'>123</a></span>
we would all go down to Old Point Comfort for
June, bathe in the sea, and get strong and well.
As for fightingâ€”it would never come to that!
</p>

<p>
On the memorable day of the 17th the "Spontaneous
Convention" again met to discuss a new
political organization of the state. While they
argued and struggled, Lieutenant-Governor Montague
entered the hall with momentous news. An
ordinance of secession had been passed by the
State Convention. This announcement was followed
by a thrilling moment of silence succeeded
by tears of gladness and deafening shouts of applause.
The venerable ex-President Tyler made a stirring
address. He gave a brief history of the struggles of
the English race from the days of the Magna Charta
to the present time, and solemnly declared that at
no period of the history of our race had we ever
been engaged in a more just and holy effort for the
maintenance of liberty and independence than at the
present moment. The career of the dominant party
at the North was but a series of aggressions which
fully warranted our eternal separation; and if we
performed our duty as Christian patriots, the same
God who favored the cause of our forefathers in the
Revolution of 1776 would crown our efforts with
success. Generations yet unborn would bless those
who had the high privilege of participating in the
present struggle. A passionate speech followed from
ex-Governor Wise. He alluded to a rumor that
one of his children had been seized and held as hostage
at the North. "But," he said, "if they suppose
hostages of my own heart's blood will stay my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124' href='#Page_124'>124</a></span>
hand in the maintenance of sacred rights, they are
mistaken. Affection for kindred, property, and life
itself sink into insignificance in comparison with the
overwhelming importance of public duty in such a
crisis as this. Virginia is smitten with blindness, in
that she does not at once seize Washington before
the Republican hordes get possession of it." The
Hon. J. M. Mason and others followed in the same
strain. Governor Letcher appeared, and pledged
himself to discharge his whole duty as executive of
the state in conformity with the will of the people
and the provisions of the constitution. The ordinance
could not become a law until it was ratified by
the peopleâ€”and they would be called to vote upon
it on May 23. "Not until then," said an ex-Congressman,
"will those fellows in Washington
know we are Secessionists!" "<i>Never</i> as Secessionists!"
said another; "I detest the word. We
are revolutionists,â€”rebels, as our fathers were."
"But perhaps," ventured one of the old Washington
coterie, to Mr. Hunter, "perhaps the people
will not vote us out of the Union after all." "My
dear lady," said the ex-Senator, proudly, "you may
place your little hand against Niagara with more certainty
of staying the torrent than you can oppose
this movement. It was written long ago in the
everlasting stars that the South would be driven out
of the Union by the North."
</p>

<p>
The fate of Virginia had been decided April 15,
when President Lincoln demanded troops for the
subjugation of the seceding states of the South.
The temper of Governor Letcher of Virginia was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125' href='#Page_125'>125</a></span>
precisely in accord with the spirit that prompted
Governor Magoffin of Kentucky to answer to a
similar call for state militia: "Kentucky will furnish
no troops for the wicked purpose of subduing
her sister Southern states!" Until this call of the
President, Virginia had been extremely averse from
secession, and even though she deemed it within her
rights to leave the Union, she did not wish to pledge
herself to join the Confederate States of the South.
Virginia was the Virginian's Country. The common
people were wont to speak of her as "The Old
Mother." "The mother of us all," a mother so
honored and loved that her brood of children must
be noble and true.
</p>

<p>
Her sons had never forgotten her! She had
fought nobly in the Revolution and had afterward
surrendered, for the common good, her magnificent
territory. Had she retained this vast dominion, she
could now have dictated to all the other states. She
gave it up from a pure spirit of patriotismâ€”that
there might be the fraternity which could not exist
without equality,â€”and in surrendering it, she had
reserved for herself the right to withdraw from the
Confederation whenever she should deem it expedient
for her own welfare. There were leading
spirits who thought the hour had come when she
might demand her right. She was not on a plane
with the other states of the Union. "Virginia, New
York, and Massachusetts had expressly reserved the
right to withdraw from the Union, and explicitly
disclaimed the right or power to bind the hands of
posterity by any form of government whatever."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126' href='#Page_126'>126</a></span>
</p>

<p>
And so the question of the hour with Virginia
was not the right to introduce slavery into the territories.
Nothing was said or thought about slavery.
The question was of states' rights only.
</p>

<p>
One need but go back to the original treaties with
France and England in 1778 and 1783, to understand
the origin and root of this feeling with the
Virginians of 1861. France had made her treaty of
perpetual alliance with the "Thirteen United
Colonies," naming each one separately as one of the
contracting parties. The king of England had
named each one separately to be "free, sovereign
and independent states" and "that he treated with
them as such."
</p>

<p>
Said old John Janney, a Union man and president
of the Convention of 1861, when taxed with having
taken sides with Virginia against the Union, "Virginia,
sir, was a nation one hundred and eighty
years before your Union was born."
</p>

<p>
Another strong party was the "Union Party,"
sternly resolved against secession, willing to run the
risks of fighting within the Union for the rights of
the state. This spirit was so strong, that any hint
of secession had been met with angry defiance. A
Presbyterian clergyman had ventured, in his morning
sermon, a hint that Virginia might need her sons
for defence, when a gray-haired elder left the church
and, turning at the door, shouted "Traitor!" This
was in Petersburg, the birthplace of General Winfield
Scott.
</p>

<p>
And still another party was the enthusiastic secession
party, resolved upon resistance to coercion; the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127' href='#Page_127'>127</a></span>
men who could believe nothing good of the North,
should interests of that section conflict with those
of the South; who cherished the bitterest resentments
for all the sneers and insults in Congress;
who, like the others, adored their own state and were
ready and willing to die in her defence. Strange to
say, this was the predominating spirit all through
the country, in rural districts as well as in the small
towns and the larger cities. It seemed to be born
all at once in every breast as soon as Lincoln
demanded the soldiers.
</p>

<p>
The "overt act" for which everybody looked
had been really the reÃ«nforcement by Federal troops
of the fort in Charleston Harbor. When Fort
Sumter was reduced by Beauregard, "the fight was
on."
</p>

<p>
On May 23 Virginia ratified an ordinance of
secession, and on the early morning of May 24
the Federal soldiers, under General Winfield Scott,<a name='FA_11' id='FA_11' href='#FN_11' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a>
crossed the Potomac River and occupied Arlington
Heights and the city of Alexandria. "The invasion
of Virginia, the pollution of her sacred soil as
it was termed, called forth a vigorous proclamation
from her governor and a cry of rage from her press."
General Beauregard issued a fierce proclamation, tending
to fire the hearts of the Virginians with anger.
"A reckless and unprincipled host," he declared,
"has invaded your soil," etc., etc.
</p>

<p>
General Scott, our father's groomsman, was knocking
at the doors of the "fair ladies" he loved, with
the menace of torch and sword.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128' href='#Page_128'>128</a></span>
</p>

<p>
And now there was a mighty gathering of the
sons of "The Old Mother!" She raised her standard,
"<i><span lang="la">Sic semper tyrannis</span></i>," and from every quarter
of the globe they rallied to her defence, not scurrying
home for shelter from the storm, but coming to
place their own breasts between her and the blast,â€”descendants
of men who had won freedom in 1776,
of Light Horse Harry Lee, of Peter Johnson,
Ensign of the Legion,â€”Robert E. Lee, Joseph E.
Johnston, Thomas Jackson, "Jeb" Stuart, A. P.
Hill, Muscoe Garnett, Roger A. Pryor, Austin Smith
from far San Francisco, Dr. Garnett from Washington,
Bradfute Warwick from Naples, Powhatan
Clark from Louisiana, Judge Scarborough from the
Court of Claims at Washington, Judge Campbell,
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court at Washington,
and multitudes of others! "The very earth
trembled at the tramp of the Virginians as they
marched to the assize of arms of the Mother of
them all. From every continent, from every clime,
from all avocations, from the bar, the pulpit, the
counting-room, the workshop, the Virginians came.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"'Theirs not to reason why,</p>
<p>Theirs but to do and die!'"<a name='FA_12' id='FA_12' href='#FN_12' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>
Among them was a descendant of old Sir Humphrey
Gilbert,â€”him of the sinking ship on his way
to Virginia,â€”who cried as he went down: "Be of
good cheer, my friends! It is as near heaven by
sea as by land."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129' href='#Page_129'>129</a></span>
</p>

<p>
And among them were some who quoted old Sir
George Somers of the <i>Sea Venture</i>, who drew around
him his crew and exhorted them to "be true to duty
and to return to Virginia."
</p>

<p>
General Bradley Johnson says these words of the
old knight rang like a trumpet all over the country
in the early days of the war wherever there was a
Virginian. "Be true to duty and return to Virginia!"
And few, very few, failed to obey the call.
</p>

<p>
It is well known that General Lee did not
approve the hasty, ill-considered action of the early
seceders from the Union. He foresaw the perils
and doubtful results of such action. He knew that
warâ€”as my own husband had so earnestly said in
Congressâ€”"meant widows and orphans, the punishment
of the innocent, the ruin of the fortunes of
all." Still, the "Old Mother" had been forced to
accept it at the hands of others. The simple question
was: "With or against blood and kin? For
or against the Old Mother?" And the question
answered itself in the asking.
</p>

<p>
I am sure that no soldier enlisted under Virginia's
banner could possibly be more determined than the
young women of the state. They were uncompromising.
</p>

<p>
"You promised me my answer to-night," said a
fine young fellow, who had not yet enlisted, to
his sweetheart.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you can't have it, Ben, until you have
fought the Yankees," said pretty Helen.
</p>

<p>
"What heart will I have for fighting if you give
me no promise?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130' href='#Page_130'>130</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I'll not be engaged to any man until he has
fought the Yankees," said Helen, firmly. "You
distinguish yourself in the war, and then see what
I'll have to say to you."
</p>

<p>
This was the stand they took in Richmond and
Petersburg. Engagements were postponed until
they could find of what mettle a lover was.
</p>

<p>
"But suppose I don't come back at all!" suggested
Ben.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, then I'll acknowledge an engagement and
be good to your mother,â€”and wear mourning all
the sameâ€”<i>provided</i>â€”your wounds are all in
front."
</p>

<p>
A few days before the vote was taken upon the
ordinance of secession we had a fine fright in Richmond.
An alarm was rung in the Capitol Square,
and thousands of people filled the streets to learn
the cause of its warning. Presently notices were
posted all over the city that the <i>Pawnee</i>â€”a war-ship
of the United Statesâ€”was steaming up the James
River with the purpose of shelling the mansions on
the banks, and of finally firing on Richmond. We
had friends living in those fine colonial mansions
all along the river,â€”at Claremont, Upper and
Lower Brandon, Shirley, Westover,â€”dear old ladies
who were unprotected, and would be frightened to
death. For ourselves in Richmond and Petersburg
there would be no personal danger, we could
escape; but our mills and shipping would be
destroyed.
</p>

<p>
I think I am within the bounds of truth when I
say that every man and boy capable of bearing gun
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131' href='#Page_131'>131</a></span>
or pistol marched with the soldiers and artillery
down to the riverside, determined to defend the city.
There they waited until the evening, the howitzers
firing from time to time to forewarn the war-ship of
their presence.
</p>

<p>
A little after sunset the crowd turned its face
homeward. News had been received that the
<i>Pawnee</i> had steamed up the river a short distance,
had thought better of it, and had turned around and
gone back to her mooring. All the same one thing
was certain, the war-ship "bristling with guns" was
there. She <i>could</i> steam up the river any night, and
probably would when it pleased her so to do.
</p>

<p>
When I returned to my father's home in Petersburg,
I found my friends possessed with an intense
spirit of patriotism. The First, Second, and Third
Virginia were already mustered into service; my
husband was colonel of the Third Virginia Infantry.
The men were to be equipped for service immediately.
All of "the boys" were goingâ€”the three
Mays, Will Johnson, Berry Stainback, Ned Graham,
all the young, dancing set, the young lawyers
and doctorsâ€”everybody, in short, except bank
presidents, druggists, a doctor or two (over age), and
young boys under sixteen.
</p>

<p>
To be idle was torture. We women resolved
ourselves into a sewing societyâ€”resting not on
Sundays. Sewing-machines were put into the
churches, which became depots for flannel, muslin,
strong linen, and even uniform cloth. When the
hour for meeting arrived, the sewing class would be
summoned by the ringing of the church bell. My
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132' href='#Page_132'>132</a></span>
dear Agnes was visiting in Petersburg, and was my
faithful ally in all my work. We instituted a monster
sewing class, which we hugely enjoyed, to meet
daily at my home on Market Street. My Colonel
was to be fitted out as never was colonel before.
He was ordered to Norfolk with his regiment to
protect the seaboard. I was proud of his colonelship,
and much exercised because he had no
shoulder-straps. I undertook to embroider them
myself. We had not then decided upon the star
for our colonels' insignia, and I supposed he
would wear the eagle like all the colonels I had
ever known. No embroidery bullion was to be had,
but I bought heavy bullion fringe, cut it in lengths,
and made eagles, probably of some extinct species,
for the like were unknown in Audubon's time, and
have not since been discovered. However, they
were accepted, admired, and, what is worse, worn.
</p>

<p>
The Confederate soldier was furnished at the beginning
of the war with a gun, pistol, canteen, tin
cup, haversack, and knapsackâ€”no inconsiderable
weight to be borne in a march. The knapsack contained
a fatigue jacket, one or two blankets, an oilcloth,
several suits of underclothing, several pairs
of white gloves, collars, neckties, and handkerchiefs.
Each mess purchased a mess-chest containing dishes,
bowls, plates, knives, forks, spoons, cruets, spice-boxes,
glasses, etc. Each mess also owned a frying-pan,
oven, coffee-pot, and camp-kettle. The
uniforms were of the finest cadet cloth and gold
lace.
</p>

<p>
This outfitâ€”although not comparable to that of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133' href='#Page_133'>133</a></span>
the Federal soldiers, many of whom had "Saratoga"
trunks in the baggage train, was considered sumptuous
by the Confederate volunteer.
</p>

<p>
As if these were not enough, we taxed our ingenuity
to add sundry comforts, weighing little, by
which we might give a touch of refinement to the
soldier's knapsack.
</p>

<p>
There was absolutely nothing which a man might
possibly use that we did not make for them. We
embroidered cases for razors, for soap and sponge,
and cute morocco affairs for needles, thread, and
court-plaster, with a little pocket lined with a bank-note.
"How perfectly ridiculous!" do you say?
Nothing is ridiculous that helps anxious women to
bear their lotâ€”cheats them with the hope that they
are doing good.

<h2>
CHAPTER X
<br />
<span class="s05">VIRGINIA AGAIN THE BATTLE-GROUND</span>
</h2>

<p>
The day came at last when our regiments
were to march. They were to rendezvous
at the head of Sycamore Street, and march
down to the lower depot. Every old man and boy,
matron, maiden, and child, every family servant,
assembled to bid them God-speed.
</p>

<p>
The reigning belles and beauties of Petersburg
were all there,â€”Alice Gregory, Tabb Bolling,
Molly and Augusta Banister, Patty Hardee, Mary
and Marion Meade, pretty Helen, and my own
friend Agnes.
</p>

<p>
"We are not to cry, you know," said Agnes, laying
down the law by right of seniority.
</p>

<p>
"Of <i>course</i> not!" said Helen, winking away her
tears and smiling.
</p>

<p>
Just then the inspiring notes of "Dixie," with
drum and clash of cymbal, rent the airâ€”the first
time I had heard that battle-song.
</p>

<p>
"Forward! March!" And they were moving in
solid ranks, all of us keeping step on the sidewalk,
down to the depot.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-152" id="i-152"></a>
<img src="images/i-152.jpg" width="550" height="357" alt="" />
<p class="caption">APPOMATTOX.</p>
</div>

<p>
When the men were on board, and the wheels
began to move, Ben leaned out of his window and
whispered to Helen, just below him:â€”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135' href='#Page_135'>135</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Can't I have the promise now, Helen?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, Benâ€”<i>dear</i> Ben, I promise!" and as
the cars rolled away she turned and calmly announced,
"Girls, I'm engaged to Ben Shepard."
</p>

<p>
"<i>I'm</i> engaged to half a dozen of them," said one.
</p>

<p>
"That's nothing," said another, "<i>I'm</i> engaged to
the whole regiment."
</p>

<p>
Poor little Helenâ€”but I must not anticipate.
</p>

<p>
After the soldiers left, silence and anxiety fell
upon the town like a pall. What should we do
next? This was the question we asked each other;
and it was answered by one of our dear women.
</p>

<p>
"We will hold a prayer meeting in each other's
houses, at four o'clock every afternoon. We can
<i>pray</i>, if we cannot fight."
</p>

<p>
This meeting was held daily throughout the years
of the warâ€”and comfort through its influence came
to many a sorrowful heart.
</p>

<p>
But the lull was of short duration. The South was
sending troops to help old Virginia.
</p>

<p>
I think Beauregard's veterans can never forget
their reception in Petersburg. We were forewarned
of their coming. We sent our servants laden with
trays of refreshments, we went ourselves to the
depot with flowers. Beauregard, our idol, the
gallant, dashing Beauregard, hurriedly shook hands
with us and filled his arms with our flowers; then,â€”"All
aboard,"â€”and off again, to be heard from
very soon at Bull Run.
</p>

<p>
Other regiments passed through town, and none
left without being refreshed. The railroad whistles
instructed us as to numbers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136' href='#Page_136'>136</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It was a happy day for me when a telegram came
from my Colonel at Norfolk: "Suppose you pay
me a visit!" There could be but one answer.
</p>

<p>
When the day of my departure arrived I was at
the depot of the train which was to take me to City
Point, long before the time of starting; and when I
reached the terminus of the short railroad, I was in
terror lest the Richmond boat might have gone on
its way without stopping for us. Would it never
come? Surely something had happened! "Oh,
Captain," I cried for the third time, as that functionary
paced to and fro in front of his little engine,
"do you think the boatâ€”" "In a moment, lady,"
said the Captain, "the boat is just coming round the
Point;" and sure enough, there she was, slowing up
to pick up the happiest woman in the world.
</p>

<p>
I can imagine few journeys more delightful than a
sail down the James River on a lovely summer day.
The river itself is not a clear stream of silver like
the Potomac. Every stream that enters it is yellow
with the peculiar clay of the country through which
it passes. But the James is, <i><span lang="fr_FR">par excellence</span></i>, the romantic
river of our country, though not like the beautiful
Hudson, misty with the dreams of Washington
Irving. The historic James needs no imaginings to
enhance its charm. Seated on the forward deck, one
glides softly over enchanted waters. Could the
veil which hides the future have been lifted from my
vision on this glorious noonday, what would have
been my sensations. Here at City Point, in the
venerable ivy-clad home of the Eppes family, General
Grant would in three short years make his headquarters,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137' href='#Page_137'>137</a></span>
and would entertain President Lincoln,
General Sherman, and Admiral Porter.
</p>

<p>
Across the river the elegant colonial house of
Shirley was basking in the summer sun. Here the
Carters had lived since 1720. Here Light Horse
Harry Lee had found his sweet wife, Anne Hill
Carter. Here, too, was the fine portrait of Washington
by Peale, and other Revolutionary treasures.
</p>

<p>
Next to Shirley, a little higher up the river, was
Turkey Island, where the English explorers had
rejoiced to find, in great numbers, the Christmas
bird, known in the mother country as early as 1527.
Here had lived the wealthy king's councilman,
William Randolph, who had come to Virginia in
the good times after King Charlie had returned to
"enjoy his own again"; and here he had built a
goodly house, with a portico on three sides, surmounted
by a dome visible a great way off to
navigators of the James River, the whole surmounted
by an aÃ«rial structure called the "bird cage
because many birds do hover and sing about it."
Seven years were required to complete this mansionâ€”and
all these seven years, doubtless, its master
was serving like Jacob, hoping to cage one fair bird
for himself.
</p>

<p>
Just across the river, at Bermuda Hundred, lived
Henry Isham, Gent: and his wife Dame Katherine;
and thither came William Randolph to smoke with
the master "a pipe of tobacco kept in a lily pot,
cut on a maple block, lighted with a coal taken with
silver tongs from a brasier of juniper"â€”for these
were the incantations wherewith the early Virginian
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138' href='#Page_138'>138</a></span>
wooed the subtle influences of the new gift of the
gods. And as they smoked, pretty Mary Isham
played on her "cittern" to the soothing accompaniment
of the lapping waves of the river. She was a
fit mate for the young aristocrat. He could trace
his lineage "from the great Earls Murray, nay, from
royalty itself"; but gentle Mary could boast on
her family tree nobler fruit than these: the Dukes of
Normandyâ€”Longue-EpÃ©e and Sanspeurâ€”Hugh
Capet of France; the Saxon kings of England; the
Magna Charta barons; and that noble house of
De Vere, which bore on its standard the lone star,
because one of their blood, hard pressed in a battle
of the Crusades, had seen in a vision a star fall from
heaven and alight upon his shield. And so it came
that William and Mary Randolph were parents of
seven noble sons, and from them descended the
great men of colonial and Revolutionary Virginiaâ€”Thomas
Jefferson, Richard Bland, Chief Justice
Marshall, Robert E. Lee. In all these times,â€”prominent
in council, in the college, in the halls of
the Executive at Philadelphia, wearing the ermine,
in the presidential chair, at the bar, in the pulpit of
the Established Church, in the march, in the battle-field,â€”in
every place where character, wisdom, and
gallant bearing were needed, we find the descendants
of William and Mary Randolph.
</p>

<p>
These were the things of which I proudly
thought (for these were my Colonel's own people)
as I was slowly borne along to other localities,â€”many
of them where the Randolphs had lived,â€”all
of them linked together in one chain of historic interest.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139' href='#Page_139'>139</a></span>
The old Randolph mansion still existed in
part, although its fine dome and pillared porticoes
had fallen into decay. As I turned my reverent
eyes to this Mecca, how would I have been cut to
the heart had the futureâ€”the near futureâ€”been
revealed to me. In one short year McClellan
would, before proceeding to Harrison's Landing,
rest after the disasters of the Seven Days' Battles
under the roof-tree at Turkey Island, and his gunboats
would shell the old mansion and level it
to the ground when it no longer sheltered their
commander.
</p>

<p>
A bend of the river now revealed Jordan's Point,
where lived in colonial and Revolutionary days
Richard Bland, the antiquary, statesman, and patriot,
over whose grave the "martial ranks of corn"
were now waving, through the stupidity of a recreant
descendant. There was no house on Jordan's Point
wherein the restless ghost of pretty Cicely Jordan
might hold tryst with her many lovers, or where the
wraith of the wise old antiquary might be discerned,
bending over the books "which he studieth much."
Pretty, rich, fascinating Cicely had in 1623 created
so much disturbance in the colony by her utter inability
to refuse a suitor, that she was the occasion
of the famous law enacting punishment for women
who promised marriage to more than one man at
a time. Here at "Jordan's" had lived another Maryâ€”Mary
Blandâ€”and thence Henry Lee had borne
her to Westmoreland; and Henry and Mary Lee
were the grandparents of Light Horse Harry, the
father of our beloved Robert E. Lee. Here, too,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140' href='#Page_140'>140</a></span>
at Jordan's, Nathaniel Bacon had encamped his followers,
before leading them to avenge the outrages
of the Indians.
</p>

<p>
But as I mused of these things we were passing
Berkley, where lived Giles Bland, who was executed
for following Nathaniel Bacon; afterward the home
of the Harrison who signed the Declaration of
Independence, the father of "old Tippecanoe,"
President William Henry Harrison. If the veil
of the future had been lifted, I should have seen
General McClellan resting on the veranda here after
his retreat from Malvern Hills, the fields for miles
around covered with his tents, the waters alive with
war vessels and transports.
</p>

<p>
Now, as I passed, the tired cattle, gathered under
the shade of a great oak near the river, were chewing
in contentment the midday cud; and at an outhouse
within sight, a woman was setting out her
newly washed milk pails to be sweetened by the sun
after her noonday dinner.
</p>

<p>
Next in interest came Westoverâ€”the fine house
built by Colonel William Byrd, to whose father my
children's ancestor had sold it. "The wise and
prudent Theodorick Bland" was sleeping there, I
knew, behind the tombstone which recorded his
wisdom and prudence, and on which his own and
his wife's arms were quartered, she having been
the daughter of the Colonial Governor Richard
Bennett. Near him in the graveyard lay the mortal
remains of Evelyn Byrdâ€”whose restless spirit slept
not ever, but might be seen on moonlight nights
gliding among the roses.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141' href='#Page_141'>141</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Then "Pace's Pains," where lived the Christian
Indian Chanco, who revealed the plan for the wholesale
massacre of the English in 1622, and who saved
Jamestown by a message at dawn to the authorities
of the town; and Argall's Point, where the settlers
were slain in the Indian massacre of 1619; and
Jamestown, where the good Mr. Hunt stretched a
sail between two trees for an altar, consecrating the
first church, floored by the leaves and flowers of the
forest and roofed by the blue sky of heaven. And
Argall'sâ€”once called Paspaheghâ€”where Nathaniel
Bacon had halted his "tyred forlorne Body of
men" to rest them before marching on to Jamestown.
</p>

<p>
And so on and onâ€”past Weyanoke and Brandon
with its art treasuresâ€”and Martin's Hundred,
where the colonists were massacred in 1622.
</p>

<p>
How peacefully the old river glided between its
banks. Now and then voices reached us from the
shores, or we paused at a busy landing to leave a
mail-bag, or to deliver packages and barrels for the
dwellers inland; or the gang-plank would be lowered
for some planter going home to his family, and soon
pulled up, the great paddle-wheels churning the thick
muddy water into a creamy froth, as we were off
again.
</p>

<p>
As late evening drew on the river became dark,
but less silent. We passed numbers of little skiffs
with a single wing and a red eye astern, in which
the fisherman was hurrying home, sometimes singing
as he sailed. Overhead the homing birds flapped
their heavy wings.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142' href='#Page_142'>142</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A sense of peace and calm stole over me. War?
Oh, surely, surely not! Something would prevent
it. Surely, blood would not be shed because of those
insulting words in the Senate and House. God was
our Fatherâ€”the Father of all. Were we not children
of His covenantâ€”His blessing promised to
the third and fourth generation? Was not the blood
of the saints in our veins?
</p>

<p>
If the veil could have been lifted, if one had said,
"Behold, I shew you a visionâ€”you may yet avert
its fulfilment," how merciful would that have been!
Could this have been vouchsafed me, I might have
had unrolled before me, that fourteenth day of June,â€”just
three years away,â€”when the man who was
now drilling a small company of volunteers in Galena
would be in these waters, crossing the James at the
head of 115,000 men, sweeping for two days and
nights over three lines of pontoons, marching horse,
foot, artillery, and train, straight to the spot whence
I had come in the morning of this day, going on
their victorious way to lay siege to Richmond and
Petersburg, and destined to overwhelm us in the
end.
</p>

<p>
And now it was quite dark on the river. Phantom
ships flashed now and then out of the darkness, and
were swallowed up again. Was that the <i>Goodspeed</i>,
or the <i>Susan Constant</i>, or perhaps the <i>Discovery</i>?
Hark! was that a war-whoop?
</p>

<p class="caption">WESTOVER.</p>
</div>

<p>
Only the warning whistle of our own boat, as I
discovered upon awaking. Before me stood the
dignified old colored woman who held the proud
position of stewardess of our boat, and beside her a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143' href='#Page_143'>143</a></span>
young assistant who gently removed and began to
fold the shawl I had tucked around my knees.
</p>

<p>
"Honey," said the old dame, "ain't you 'fraid
you'll ketch cole out here so late?â€”it's time for
you to go to bed. The cap'n sent me for you.
Yo' state-room is nice an' cool now. The potehole
been open ever since sundown."
</p>

<p>
I was awake and dressed by sunrise next day, our
boat having arrived after midnight at the wharf in
Norfolkâ€”and in due time the clanking of spurs announced
my Colonel! Very fine did he look in his
uniform, with my eagles bristling on each shoulder.
</p>

<p>
There was to be a dress-parade that day, in the
afternoon, and he desired me to join the ladies of
the hotel in the drawing-room after breakfast and
present with his compliments an invitation to the
parade.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know when and where I can see the
ladies of this hotel?" I asked my smiling colored
chambermaid.
</p>

<p>
"Lor', lady, dey ain't fur off," she said. "Dey
mostly sets all day in de shady side of de po'ch
pickin' lint. Dey certainly makes a heap o' muss.
Nobody can't say nuthin' to 'em; cause deyse guests
of de hotel. An' 'tain't one bit o' use. Nobody
gwine to git hurt, an' if dey does, what's de use of
all dat sticky cotton?"
</p>

<p>
I found a number of ladies engaged in the
veranda, but not as she had suggested. They
were very glad to meet me, and accepted my invitation.
They were making square bags out of bunting
for cartridges. A gentle, blue-eyed woman joined us
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144' href='#Page_144'>144</a></span>
and asked for work. But when it was explained to
her, she colored, her lips quivered. "Oh, I can't!
I can't!" she begged. "Let me roll bandages for
wounds! I can't help with the cartridges! You see,
all my people live in Pennsylvania. My husband
is going to fight them, I know; but don't ask me
to make the cartridges."
</p>

<p>
My Colonel came himself with his staff in the
afternoon to escort us to his headquarters at the
Marine Hospital. On our way we passed an abandoned
house, on the walls of which grew the most
glorious specimen of fuchsia I ever beheld. I had
always heard that this was a marine plant, and I
now saw to what perfection it could be brought in
the sea air. It reached to the second story and was
covered with a shower of great scarlet and blue bells.
"Dixie colors," said one of the ladies. We gathered
gorgeous bunches and fastened them in our white
dresses.
</p>

<p>
The parade ground was a lovely stretch of green,
and beyond, the blue waters of the sea sparkled in
the afternoon sun, each little wave gemmed with a
diamond and set in sapphire.
</p>

<p>
A siege gun had just been mounted, and there
was to be practice-firing at a buoy for a mark.
</p>

<p>
I was standing with my group of friends when a
handsome officer approached with a military salute
and invited me to honor his company by firing their
first gun. I went forward with him, and he put the
lanyard in my hands.
</p>

<p>
"Wait for the word of command, Madam," he
said.
</p>

<p>
"And then what?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, then <i>pull</i> steadily," and with that he stepped
back.
</p>

<p>
"Make ready! Fire!"
</p>

<p>
I pulled the lanyardâ€”but I was unprepared for
the result. The great gun backed, leaped in the air
and sent a mighty roar across the waters,â€”the first
cannon fired by the Third Virginia Volunteers. I received
the congratulations and thanks of the Captain,
and returned to my placeâ€”to be told that my eyes
were congested by the concussion, and that I must
return home and bathe and bandage them at once.
Evidently I was not fit for artillery service.

<h2>
CHAPTER XI
<br />
<span class="s05">LIFE AT THE OAKS</span>
</h2>

<p>
The month of July, 1861, found me with my
little boys at "The Oaks"â€”the residence
of Dr. Izard Bacon Rice, in Charlotte
County, seventy miles from Richmond, and miles
away from the nearest railroad depot. There I
might have enjoyed a peaceful summer with my kind
hostâ€”a fine type of a Christian gentleman, sometime
an Old-Line Whig and fierce Union man, now
an ardent advocate of states' rights, and a stanch
supporter of the New Confederacy. I mightâ€”as I
had often done beforeâ€”have revelled in the fine
trees; the broad acres of tobacco in their summer
prime, when the noble plant was proudly flinging out
its banners before its fall; the old garden with its
box-edged crescents, stars, and circles,â€”I might
have dreamed away the summer in perfect contentment
but for General Beauregard. Distant as was
his army, a message from his guns reached my
summer retreat more than a hundred miles away.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Rice lived in a large, old-fashioned house, on
a plantation of two thousand acres or more. An oak
grove, alive with chattering squirrels which had been
held sacred for two generations, surrounded the house.
The squirrels held conventions in the trees, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147' href='#Page_147'>147</a></span>
doubtless expressed their opinions of the family below,
whom they had good reason to consider inferior
beings, inasmuch as they were slow-motioned, heavy
creatures, utterly destitute of grace and agility, and
with small appreciation of hickory-nuts.
</p>

<p>
The Doctor cultivated tobacco, and when I arrived
the fields stretched as far as the eye could
reach, now a vast level sea of green, now covering
the low, gently rounded, undulating hills as they
sloped down to the Staunton River. There was
never a season when these fields were not alive with
laborers of every age; for the regal plant so beloved
of menâ€”and ranking with opium and hemp as a
solace for the ills of mankindâ€”has enemies from
the hour it peeps from the nursery of the hot bed.
It can never be forgotten a moment. Children can
hunt the fly which seeks to line the leaf with eggs,
or destroy the unhatched eggs, or aid the great army
which must turn out in haste when the ravenous
worm is born. The earth must be turned frequently
at the roots, the flower buds pinched off, the shoots
or "suckers" removed. The Doctor's tobacco field
was an enlivening spectacle, and very picturesque
did the ebony faces of the little workers look,
among the broad leaves. No lady's garden was
ever kept so clean, so free from sticks, errant bits
of paper, or dÃ©bris of any kind.
</p>

<p>
I do not claim that Dr. Rice (my uncle) was a
typical planterâ€”as far as the government of his
slaves was concerned. He had inherited liberal
ideas with these inherited slaves. His grandfather,
David Rice, had written the first published protest
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148' href='#Page_148'>148</a></span>
in this country against slavery as "inconsistent with
religion and policy." His father had ruled a plantation
where severe punishment was unknown, where
the cheerful slaves rarely needed it. The old gentleman
was considered eccentricâ€”and eccentric it
surely was for a master to punish a fault by commanding
the culprit to stand in his presence while
he recited a long passage from Homer or Virgil!
The punishment was effective. For fear of it, the
fault was rarely repeated.
</p>

<p>
It was my uncle's custom to assemble every slave
on his plantation on Sunday morning, and to speak
a few words to each one, commending the women if
their families appeared in clean, well-kept garments,
rewarding with a pair of shoes the urchins reported
by "Uncle Moses" as having been orderly and
useful, exchanging a pleasant jest here and there.
</p>

<p>
He presented a tight, comfortable house to every
newly married pair, with timber for the bridegroom
to add to it, or to enclose the piece of land for a
garden or a poultry yard which went with it. Every
mother at the birth of a child was presented with a
pig. The plantation, which was large and fruitful,
and from which nothing but tobacco and wheat was
ever sold, yielded vegetables, poultry, mutton, beef,
bacon in lavish abundance, while the orchards and
vines were equally productive.
</p>

<p>
Some hundreds of the negroes of the neighborhood
were members of the Presbyterian church of
the whites. In the old church books may be seen
to-day records of their marriages and funerals, and
how (for example) "Lovelace Brown was brought
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149' href='#Page_149'>149</a></span>
before the session for hog-stealing and suspended
for one month." But there were better records than
this. These Presbyterian negroes were at one time
led by an eminent patriarch, Uncle Abel, who deserves
more than a passing notice. He had been
taught to read and had been well drilled in the
Shorter Catechism. But his marriage ceremonies
were always read from the Episcopal Prayer-book,
every word of which he held sacred, not to be
changed or omitted to suit any modern heresy.
"I M, take thee N," was the formula for Jack
or Peter, Dilsey or Diceyâ€”and "with this ring
I thee wed" must be pronounced with solemnity,
ring or no ring, the latter being not at all essential.
</p>

<p>
My uncle's old family coach, punctual to the
minute, swept around the circle on the lawn every
Sunday morning, with Uncle Peter proudly guiding
the horses from his high perch. And high-swung
was the coach, to be ascended (as we ascended our
four-poster beds) by three carpeted steps,â€”in
the case of the carriage, folding steps, which were
tucked inside after we had disposed of ourselves,
with our ample hoops. There was plenty of room
inside. Pockets lined the doors, and these were
filled by my aunt with beaten biscuit and sugar-cakes
"for the little darkies on the road."
</p>

<p>
Arriving at the church, the gentlemen from the
adjacent plantations, who had been settling the
affairs of the nation under the trees, came forward
to hand us from our carriage, after the manner of
old-time cavaliers and sedan-chairs; and my aunt
and I would be very gracious, devoutly hoping in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150' href='#Page_150'>150</a></span>
our hearts that my uncle and his sons would not
forget a reciprocal courtesy when Mrs. Winston
Henry, Mrs. Paul Carrington, and Mrs. Sarah
Carrington should arrive.
</p>

<p>
The women all seated themselves on the right
side of the church, while the men, during the
singing of a preliminary hymn, came in like a
processional and took the left as their portion,â€”all
of which (except the advertisements on the
church doors) was conducted precisely according to
the customs of Revolutionary times, when Patrick
Henry and John Randolph, now sleeping a few
miles away, were themselves (we trust) church-goers.
</p>

<p>
Church dinners at home were simple, but abundant,â€”so
that if three or four carriages should
arrive from distant plantations in the neighborhood,
there could be welcome and refreshment for all,
but on the great days when my uncle and aunt received
the neighborhood, when the Carringtons and
Patrick Henry's sons, John and Winston, came
with their families to spend the day, the dinner was
something to be remembered. Perhaps a description
verbatim from an old family servant will be
better than anything I can furnish from memory.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir! We had fine dinners in them days.
The butter was moulded like a temple with pillars,
and a rose stuck in the top. There was a wreath
of roses roun' all the dessert dishes. Viney biled
the ham in cider. We had roas' pig, biled turkey,
chickens fried an' briled, spring lam', ducks an' green
goslin'. An' every cut-glass dish in the house was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151' href='#Page_151'>151</a></span>
full of preserves, an' the great bowl full of ice-cream,
an' floatin' island, an' tipsy-cake, an' cheese-cakes,
an' green sweetmeats, an' citron. John was bothered
where to set all the dishes."

<p>
Our guests would remain late, that they might
have the cool evening hours for their long drives.
Mr. John Henry, with his family of gifted sons and
beautiful daughters, lived at Red Hill, the home of
his father, the great orator and patriot, under the
trees his father had planted and near the grave where
he sleeps. Mr. Winston Henry had also an interesting
family, and lived in an old colonial house not
far away, surrounded by grounds filled in summer
with pomegranates and gardenias, and with lemon
and orange trees in tubs, also great <i>trees</i> of heliotrope,
and vines of jessamineâ€”a paradise of beauty
and sweetness. Rosalie Henry would bring her
guitar to my uncle's and sing for us by the hour.
She was so loved, so cherished by her parents, that
they gave her a bedroom over their own, to which
she ascended by a stairway from their own apartmentâ€”all
that they might be near her. But one morning
early, pretty Rosalie changed gowns with her
maid, put a pail on her head, and slipped past her
trusting, adoring parents to join her lover in the
jessamine bower, and in a bridal robe of linsey-woolsey
was married at the next town! Then it was
that my good uncle had his opportunity. The sublime
teaching of forgiveness was respected from his
kindly lips.
</p>

<p>
In the early summer of '61 Virginia planters
were not all <i><span lang="fr_FR">d'accord</span></i> on political questions; and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152' href='#Page_152'>152</a></span>
like Agag, it behooved us to "walk delicately" in
conversation. One thing they would not endure.
Politics were to be kept out of the pulpit. Never
had the pastor such attentive congregations; they
were watching him, keenly alive to the remotest hint
or allusion to the war. His business was with the
spiritual kingdom of God. He must not interfere
with CÃ¦sar's. He found it expedient to omit for the
present the warlike aspirations of David, in which
he beseeches the Lord's attention to his enemies,
and, among other things calculated to comfort and
soothe his pious feelings, prays that they may be as
"stubble before the wind," as "wood before fire,"
and be "rooted forever out of the land of the
living."
</p>

<p>
"Enemies" were not to be alluded to in the
pulpit. Nor, indeed, not yet in private! It was
proper and in good taste to speak of them as
"Federals"; but at no very distant day these
same polite gentlemen called them "enemies" with
a will; when scornfully disposed, they were "Yankees,"
and when they wished to be positively insulting,
"Yanks."
</p>

<p>
Across the river from the Oaks was "Mildendo,"
the home of the Carrington family. From this
home went every man capable of bearing armsâ€”Fontaine,
the fine young surgeon so well placed in
the United States Navy, and his brother, the grave
head of the house upon whom everybody depended;
and one, a cousin, leaving his bride at the altar.
Patrick Henry's grandsons all enlisted. Mr. Charles
Bruce left his baronial castle on Staunton Hill near
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153' href='#Page_153'>153</a></span>
the Oaks, equipped the "Staunton Hill Artillery
Company" at his own expense, placed himself at
its head and shared all its hardships. His brother,
Mr. James Bruce, cut up his rich carpets and curtains
for the soldiers' blankets. These were but a few of
the gallant neighbors of my uncle, who exchanged
homes of luxury for the hardships of warâ€”all of
whom probably shared General Lee's keen sorrow
at the necessity forced upon Virginia to withdraw
her allegiance from the Union.
</p>

<p>
My uncle had a son already in the cavalry serviceâ€”and
another, Henry, a fine young fellow of
sixteen, was at Hampden-Sidney College, Virginia.
Presently a letter from the latter filled the family at
the Oaks withâ€”yes, anxietyâ€”but at the same
time a proud sense of how old Revolutionary
"blood will tell." Henry was on the march! At
the first tocsin of war the students of Hampden-Sidney
had rushed to armsâ€”most of them under
age; and when their president, the venerated Rev.
John Atkinson, found they would go, he placed
himself at their head as their captain. Military
tactics had not been included in his theological training.
So promptly had he responded to the call
of his country he had no opportunity to drill his
young soldiers according to the rules of Hardee and
Jomini; but he did more for them than this. His
fatherly care and his example of courage, fortitude,
and faith in the cause inspired them to bear hardships
which were severe almost beyond their powers
of endurance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154' href='#Page_154'>154</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the inexperience of their captain,
these boys, fresh from their college halls, were
often publicly complimented as they headed the
column in the long marches over the mountains
of Virginia.
</p>

<p>
When they were called to Richmond their patriotic
ardor received a shock. Governor Letcher
seriously took under consideration the propriety of
sending them back to school on account of their
youth. A committee from the company waited
upon him, and he was finally prevailed upon to
allow them to go to the front.
</p>

<p>
They soon learned what war wasâ€”these beardless
college boys, and bore themselves gallantly in
several engagements. But their military career was
brief. McClellan flanked their position at Rich
Mountain, July 12, 1861, and cut off every avenue
of retreat. The whole command, after a sharp engagement,
were made prisoners of war. For the
time being the boys felt their military career to have
been an inglorious failure.
</p>

<p>
While they were thus disappointed and depressed,
a Federal officer, presumably a lieutenant, visited
them in the prison camp. He said he had heard so
much of the boy soldiers led by their college president
that he wished to make their acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
The boys were not by way of being over anxious
to receive visits from their victors. The officer
asked, "Why in the world are you here?"
</p>

<p>
"We are here to <i>fight</i>!" said they. "What do
you suppose we came for?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, boys," said the officer, pleasantly, "make
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155' href='#Page_155'>155</a></span>
yourselves easy. I'll send you home to your mothers
in a few days."
</p>

<p>
The officer was General McClellan!
</p>

<p>
The company was paroled, but was not exchanged
for a year. This prolonged parole, they always
thought, was due to General McClellan's influence
in order to give them a whole year at college.
</p>

<p>
They all returned to the army after their exchange,
but never as the "Hampden-Sidney Boys."
They never forgot the little interview with the General.
He won all their hearts.
</p>

<p>
Our own Hampden-Sidney boy, Henry Rice, soon
afterward wrote from a hospital in Richmond that
he was ill with fever. My uncle ordered him home,
and I took the great family coach and Uncle Peter
and went to the depot, fourteen miles away, to fetch
him. He looked so long, that I doubted whether
I could bestow him in the carriage; and as he was
too good a soldier for me to suggest that he be
"doubled up," I entered the carriage first, had his
head and shoulders placed in my lap, then closed
the door and swung his long legs out of the window!
</p>

<p>
My uncle was a fine specimen of a Christian
gentlemanâ€”always courteous, always serene. I
delighted in following him around the plantation on
horseback. When he winnowed his wheat, Uncle
Moses, standing like an emperor amid the sheaves,
filled the hearts of my little boys with ecstasy by
allowing them to ride the horses that turned the
great wheel. Finally the wheat was packed in bags,
and we stood on the bank of the river to see it piled
into flat-bottomed boats on the way to market.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156' href='#Page_156'>156</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The next morning Moses appeared at the dining
room door while we were at breakfast.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Moses," said my uncle. "I
thought you were going with the wheat."
</p>

<p>
"Dar ain't no wheat," said the old man. "Hit's
all at de bottom of the river."
</p>

<p>
"How did that happen?"
</p>

<p>
"We jest natchelly run agin a snag; when de
boat turn over, hit pulled all de others down. 'Cose
you know, Marster, dey was tied together, an' boat
ain' got no eyes to see snags."
</p>

<p>
"Wellâ€”get out your chains and grappling hooks,
Moses, and save all you can. It will do to feed the
chickens."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Uncle!" I exclaimed, "how calmly you
take it."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," said he; "because I've lost my crop
is that any reason I should lose my temper? Here,
Pizarro, have our horses saddled. We'll go down
to the river and encourage Moses to resurrect his
wheat." (Pizarro was John's son. John had studied
with the boys of the family, and knew some
history and Latin. One of the women bore the
classic name of "Lethe"; others were "Chloe"
and "Daphne"; another name, frequently repeated,
was "Dicey"â€”a survival, according to Mr. Andrew
Lang, of the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, which
was found among the Indians and the Virginia
negroes of colonial times. Orpheus seems to have
perished from their traditions, but Dicey is still a
favorite name. The descendants of Lethe and
Pizarro still live at the Oaks. A late achievement
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157' href='#Page_157'>157</a></span>
shows their progress under new conditions, the baptismal
records having been enriched with "Hazel-Kirke-Florida-Bell-Armazinda-Hodge,"
more imposing if
less suggestive than the "Homicide" and "Neuralgia"
of a neighboring county.)
</p>

<p>
This precise type of a Virginia plantation will
never appear again, I imagine. I wish I could describe
a plantation wedding as I saw it that summer.
But a funeral of one of the old servants was peculiarly
interesting to me. "Aunt Matilda" had been
much loved, and when she found herself dying, she
had requested that the mistress and little children
should attend her funeral. "I ain' been much to
church," she urged, "I couldn't leave my babies. I
ain' had dat shoutin' an' hollerin' religion, but I gwine
to heaven jes' de same"â€”a fact of which nobody who
knew Aunt Matilda could have the smallest doubt.
</p>

<p>
We had a long, warm walk behind hundreds of
negroes, following the rude coffin in slow procession
through the woods, singing antiphonally as they
went one of those strange, weird hymns not to be
caught by any Anglo-Saxon voice.
</p>

<p>
It was a beautiful and touching scene, and at the
grave I longed for an artist (we had no kodaks
then) to perpetuate the picture. The level rays of
the sun were filtered through the green leaves of
the forest, and fell gently on the dusky, pathetic
faces, and on the simple coffin surrounded by orphan
children and relatives, very dignified and quiet in
their grief.
</p>

<p>
The spiritual patriarch of the plantation presided.
Old Uncle Abel said:â€”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158' href='#Page_158'>158</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I ain' gwine keep you all long. 'Tain' no use.
We can't do nothin' for Sis' Tildy. All is done fer
her, an' she done preach her own fune'al sermon.
Her name was on dis church book here, but dat
warn' nothin', 'dout 'twas on de Lamb book too!
</p>

<p>
"Now whiles dey fillin' up her grave I'd like you
all to sing a hymn Sis' Tildy uster love, but you
all know I bline in one eye, an' de sweat done got
in de other; so's I can't see to line it out, an' I
dunno as any o' you all ken do it"â€”and the first
thing I knew, the old man had passed his well-worn
book to me, and there I stood, at the foot of the
grave, "lining out":â€”
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Asleep in Jesus, blessed sleep</p>
<p>From which none ever wakes to weep,"â€”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
words of immortal comfort to the great throng of
negro mourners who caught it up, line after line, on
an air of their own, full of tears and tenderness,â€”a
strange, weird tune no white person's voice could
ever follow.
</p>

<p>
Among such scenes I passed the month of June
and the early part of July, and then General Beauregard
reminded us that we were at war, and had no
right to make ourselves comfortable.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Rice, on the afternoon of the 21st, had betaken
himself to his accustomed place under the
trees, to escape the flies,â€”the pest of Southern
households in summer,â€”and had lain down on the
grass for his afternoon nap. He suddenly called
out excitedly: "There's a battle going onâ€”a fierce
battleâ€”I can hear the cannonading distinctly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159' href='#Page_159'>159</a></span>
Hereâ€”lie downâ€”you can hear it!" "Oh, no,
no, I can't!" I gasped. "It may be at Norfolk."
</p>

<p>
Like Jessie, who had heard the pibroch at the
siege of Lucknow, he had heard, with his ear to the
ground, the firing at Manassas. The battle of Bull
Run was at its height. We found it difficult to
understand that he <i>could</i> have heard cannonading one
hundred and fifty miles away. We had not then
spoken across the ocean and been answered.

CHAPTER XII
<br />
<span class="s05">BULL RUN AND FAIR OAKS</span>
</h2>

<p>
We had small faith in my uncle's wireless
telegraphy, but in a short time we had
confirmation of his news.
</p>

<p>
Then came the details of the first great battle of
the war. "Glorious news!" everybody said. A
glorious triumph for the South,â€”an utter rout of
the enemy; but my heart sank within me at the tale
of blood. How about those boys I had seen march
away? What would life hold for some of the wives
and mothers and sweethearts at home?
</p>

<p>
What was glory to the gallant Colonel Bartow,
lying in state at the capitol in Richmond? Could
glory dry his widow's tears or console his aged
mother? We gathered details of the last moments
of the men who fell. It was all so strange! <i>Could</i> it
be true that these things had actually happened in
Virginia?
</p>

<p>
Our men, when the bodies were brought home,
could tell many stories of officersâ€”but how about
the boys in the ranks? Bartow had been unhorsed
in the fight, and his aide, young Lamar, dashed across
the field amid a hail of bullets to procure another
mount for his Colonel. Suddenly Lamar was seen
to fall with his horse. Extricating himself, and perceiving
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161' href='#Page_161'>161</a></span>
that his horse was shot, he started to proceed
on foot; the wounded animal tried to rise and follow.
Our men saw Lamar turn in that deadly fire,
stoop down, and pat the poor horse on the neck.
Another volley of bullets ended the noble animal's
life, and Lamar returned just in time to bear Bartow's
body from the field.
</p>

<p>
I grew so restless and unhappy that I turned my
face homeward to Petersburg. My resolution was
taken. I steadily withstood all the entreaties of my
friends, and determined to follow my husband's regiment
through the war. I did not ask his permission.
I would give no trouble. I should be only a help
to his sick men and his wounded. I busied myself
in preparing a camp equipageâ€”a field-stove with a
rotary chimney, ticks for bedding, to be filled with
straw or hay or leaves as the case might be, a camp
chest of tin utensils, strong blankets, etc. A tent
could always be had from Major Shepard, our
quartermaster. News soon came that the Third Virginia
had been ordered to Smithfield. McClellan
was looking toward the Peninsula, and Major-General
Joseph E. Johnston was keeping an eye on
McClellan.
</p>

<p>
When I set forth on what my father termed my
"wild-goose chase," I found the country literally
alive with troops. The train on which I travelled
was switched off again and again to allow them to
pass. My little boys had the time of their lives,
cheering the soldiers and picnicking at short intervals
all day.
</p>

<p>
But Smithfield would not hear of the camp outfit.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162' href='#Page_162'>162</a></span>
The great box was trundled away to the warehouse,
and I was hospitably taken into one of the homes
of the little town.
</p>

<p>
After a while things looked as if I would probably
stay in Smithfield the rest of my natural life. So I
rented a small furnished house, bought a cow, opened
an account with Mr. Britt, the grocer, also with a
fisherman who went out every night on Pagan Creek
with a light in his boat, drew his blanket around him
and dozed, while the fat little mullets jumped in for
my breakfast. Until the mullet species becomes
extinct nobody need starve in Smithfield.
</p>

<p>
The Third Virginia and its Colonel were giving
themselves up to murmurs and discontent at being
"buried in Smithfield" while gallant fighting was
going on elsewhere, meanwhile studying Hardee and
Jomini with all their might. Not one of the officers
or men had ever before seen military service. The
daily drill was the only excitement.
</p>

<p>
Here they were, fastened hand and foot, strong,
ardent fellows, while so much was going on elsewhere,â€”Stonewall
Jackson marching on his career of
glory, Beauregard ordered to active service in the
West, Fort Henry and Fort Donelson surrendered
to the enemy, our army falling back from Manassas,
the mighty Army of the Potomac divided and scattered.
Then came news that General Lee, whose
first appointment was from Virginia, was to have
command of all the armies of the Confederacy.
</p>

<p>
Major-General Pemberton (the gallant hero who
held Vicksburg against such odds) was then our commanding
officer at Smithfield. His wife and her sister,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163' href='#Page_163'>163</a></span>
Miss Imogene Thompson, were our grand dames,â€”deserving
the admiration we accorded them. The
beauty of the town was Mary Garnett; the spirited
belle who wore brass buttons and a military cap,
Miss Riddick. Despite all the discouraging news,
these young people mightily cheered the spirits of
the officers and helped them to bear inglorious inaction
with becoming fortitude.
</p>

<p>
General Pemberton varied our own routine somewhat
by giving an occasional dinner party. Once
he invited us to an early morning drive to Cooper's
Point, opposite Newport News, where the warships
<i>Congress</i> and <i>Cumberland</i> were anchored, with
whose guns (so soon to be silenced by the iron-clad
<i>Merrimac</i>) we were already familiar. We were a
merry party, assembled in open wagons on a frosty
morning, and we enjoyed the drive with fleet horses
through the keen air. Miss Imogene Thompson's
lover was a prisoner of war on board one of the
ships. "Look out for the ball and chain, Imogene!"
said the General, as we arrived in sight of the ships.
Through a glass we could see the brave fellows, so
soon to go down with their colors flying before the
relentless <i>Merrimac</i>, but not with pretty Imogene's
lover, who lived to make her happy after the cruel
war was over.
</p>

<p>
Another event of personal interest was the presentation
to the Colonel by the ladies of Petersburg
of a blue silken state flag. The party came
down the river in a steamboat, and we stood on
the river bank in a stiff breeze while the presentation
speech covered the ground of all the possibilities
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164' href='#Page_164'>164</a></span>
in store for the Colonel, ending with, "And, sir,
if you <i>should</i> fall," and promises of tears and true
faithful hearts to love and honor him forever. In
his answer of thanks he expressed all the gratitude
and chivalry of his heart, but craved sympathy for
his present state of enforced idlenessâ€”"for the
dearest sacrifice a man can make for his country is
his ambition."
</p>

<p>
Soon afterwards he was called to Richmond to
take his seat in Congressâ€”and as there was nothing
to keep him with the regiment, he left it with
his Lieutenant-Colonel.
</p>

<p>
But I did not return with him. I had enlisted
for the war! For some reason, which was not explained
at the time, he suddenly returned, and my
only knowledge of his coming was a peremptory
official order to change my baseâ€”to leave Smithfield
next morning at daybreak! The orderly who
brought it stood before me as I read, and looked
intensely surprised when I said: "Tell the Colonel
it is impossible! I can't get ready by to-morrow
morning to leave."
</p>

<p>
"Madam," said the man, gravely, "it is none of
my business, but when Colonel Pryor gives an order,
it is best to be a strict constructionist."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Britt proved a tower of strength. He closed
his store and brought all his force to help me. My
cow was presented with my compliments to my
neighbor, Mrs. Smith, under promise of secrecy (for
I knew I must not alarm the town by my precipitate
departure), my camp equipage brought from the
warehouse, my belongings all packed. As the sun
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165' href='#Page_165'>165</a></span>
rose next morning, I greeted him from my seat on
a trunk in an open wagon on my way to Zuni, the
railway station fifteen miles away. I never saw a
lovelier morning. The cattle were all afield for their
early breakfast of dewy grass, a thin line of smoke was
ascending from the cottages on the wayside. The
mother could be seen within, preparing breakfast for
the children, who stood in the door to gaze at us
as we passed. The father was possibly away in the
army, although the times were not yet so stern that
every man became a conscript. These humbler
folk who lived close to the highwayâ€”what sufferings
were in store for them from the pillage of the
common soldier! What terror and dismay for the
dwellers in the broad-porticoed, many-chambered
mansions beyond the long avenues of approach in
the distance! I could but think of these things
when I heard the boom of guns on the warships
at Newport News, sounds to which my ears had
grown accustomed, but which now took on, somehow,
a new meaning.
</p>

<p>
I soon learned that the Third Virginia Regiment
moved the day after I received my own marching
orders.
</p>

<p>
McClellan had landed about one hundred thousand
efficient troops on the Peninsula for the movement
upon Richmond. General Joseph E. Johnston's
line of about fifty-three thousand men extended
across the narrow neck of land between the York
and the James. They gave McClellan battle May 5
at Williamsburg, captured four hundred unwounded
prisoners, ten colors, and twelve field-pieces, slept on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166' href='#Page_166'>166</a></span>
the field of battle, and marched off the next morning
at their leisure and convenience. After this my
Colonel was brevetted Brigadier-General.
</p>

<p>
The news of his probable promotion reached me
at the Exchange Hotel in Richmond, whither I had
gone that I might be near headquarters, and thus
learn the earliest tidings from the Peninsula. There
the Colonel joined me for one day. We read with
keen interest the announcement in the papers that
his name had been sent in by the president for
promotion. Mrs. Davis held a reception at the
Spotswood Hotel on the evening following this
announcement, and we availed ourselves of the opportunity
to make our respects to her.
</p>

<p>
A crowd gathered before the Exchange to congratulate
my husband, and learning that he had
gone to the Spotswood, repaired thither, and with
many shouts and cheers called him out for a speech.
This was very embarrassing, and he fled to a corner
of the drawing-room and hid behind a screen of
plants. I was standing near the president, trying
to hold his attention by remarks on the weather and
kindred subjects of a thrilling nature, when a voice
from the street called out: "Pryor! <i>General</i> Pryor!"
I could endure the suspense no longer, and asked
tremblingly, "Is this true, Mr. President?" Mr.
Davis looked at me with a benevolent smile and
said, "I have no reason, Madam, to doubt it, except
that I saw it this morning in the papers," and
Mrs. Davis at once summoned the bashful Colonel:
"What are you doing lying there <i><span lang="fr_FR">perdu</span></i> behind the
geraniums? Come out and take your honors."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167' href='#Page_167'>167</a></span>
The next day my bristling eagles, which had faithfully
held guard on the Colonel's uniform, retired
before the risen stars of the Brigadier-General.
</p>

<p>
On May 31 "Old Joe" and "Little Mac," as
they were affectionately called by their respective
commands, again confronted each other, and fought
the great two days' battle of Fair Oaks, or Seven
Pines.
</p>

<p>
This battle was said to have been one of the
closest, most hotly contested, and bloody of the
war. A few miles from Petersburg the cannonading
could be distinctly heard, and ten or twelve of
the Federal observation balloons could be seen in
the air.
</p>

<p>
McClellan had an army of one hundred thousand;
Johnston had sixty-three thousand. The afternoon
and night before a terrible storm had raged, "sheets
of fire, lightning, sharp and dreadful thunderclaps,
were fit precursors of the strife waged by the artillery
of man.
</p>

<p>
"All night long Zeus, the lord of counsel, devised
them ill with terrible thunderings. Then pale fear
gat hold upon them."<a name='FA_13' id='FA_13' href='#FN_13' class='fnanchor'>[13]</a>
</p>

<p>
The roads were deep with mud. With many disadvantages
Johnston attacked, with vigor, the corps
of Keyes and Heintzelman, drove them back, and
came near inflicting upon them a crushing defeat.
Near the end of the fight General Johnston was
wounded and borne from the field, smiling and saying,
"I'm not sure I am much hurt, but I fear that
bit of shell may have injured my spine."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168' href='#Page_168'>168</a></span>
</p>

<p>
He had already been wounded by a musket-ball,
his enthusiasm having carried him nearer to the
fight than a commanding officer has any right to be.
</p>

<p>
A little later he had observed one of his colonels
trying to dodge the shell.
</p>

<p>
"Colonel," he said, "there is no use dodging!
When you hear them, they have passed."
</p>

<p>
Just then he fell unconscious into the arms of one
of his couriers. A shell had exploded, striking him
on the breast. The moment he regained consciousness
his unwounded hand sought his sword and
pistols. They were gone!
</p>

<p>
"I would not lose my sword for ten thousand
dollars," he exclaimed. "My father wore it in the
war of the Revolution." The courierâ€”Drury L.
Armsteadâ€”dashed back through the storm of artillery,
found both sword and pistols, brought them
safely, and received one of the pistols as a token of
the gratitude of his chief.<a name='FA_14' id='FA_14' href='#FN_14' class='fnanchor'>[14]</a>
</p>

<p>
In General George E. Pickett's report of this
hard-won battle he says, "Pryor and Wilcox were
on my right; our men moved beautifully and carried
everything before them."
</p>

<p>
General Johnston was succeeded by General Lee.
I did not know for a long time (for, so absorbing
were the events that rapidly followed, the honors
of battle were forgotten) that, after the capture at
Fair Oaks of the Federal brigade under General
Casey, "General Roger A. Pryor went around
among the wounded, giving them whiskey and water,
and told them it was a repayment of the kindness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169' href='#Page_169'>169</a></span>
with which the wounded Confederate prisoners were
treated at 'Williamsburg,'"<a name='FA_15' id='FA_15' href='#FN_15' class='fnanchor'>[15]</a>â€”an incident which I
hope I may be pardoned for relating, since the generous
tribute affords an example of the spirit of that
true Christian gentleman, General McClellan.
</p>

<p>
"He never struck a foul blow and never tolerated
mean men or mean methods about him. His was
a high ideal of war, a high sense of chivalry which is
the duty of fighting the belligerent and sparing the
weak. His conduct was keyed to the highest point
of honor and generosity in war." When his march
led him to the "White House," whence General
Washington took his bride, Martha Custis, he
ordered a guard to be placed around it; and finding
himself alone in St. Peter's Church, where Washington
was married, he records in his diary, "I could
not help kneeling at the chancel and praying that I
might save my country as truly as he did." This
was just before the battle at Seven Pines, in which
there were probably arrayed against him the near
kindred of Martha Washington. What would they
have thought of the invading general's prayer to
"save the country"? And <i>his</i> country! And at
the altar he held in especial homage because of their
grandsire!
</p>

<p>
Like McClellan, Johnston had not the good
fortune to be in accord with his Executive. "Not
only," said an Old Virginian to him as he lay suffering
from his severe wounds, "not only do we deplore
this cruel affliction upon you, General, but we
feel it to be a national calamity."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170' href='#Page_170'>170</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," said Johnston, fiercely, rising suddenly
upon his unbroken elbow. "The shot that struck
me down was the best ever fired for the Southern
Confederacy, for I possessed in no degree the confidence
of this government, and now a man who
does enjoy it will succeed me, and be able to accomplish
what I never could."
</p>

<p>
The man who succeeded him, General Lee, wrote
to the Secretary of War: "If General Johnston was
not a soldier, America never produced one. If he
was not competent to command the army, the Confederacy
had no one who was competent." But
even Lee could not control the opinions of the
Executive. General Johnston was relieved from his
command in 1864. General McClellan's treatment,
as the world knows, was hardly less severe and quite
as undeserved.
</p>

<p>
Richmond heard the guns of this bloody battle.
As soon as the storm allowed them, crowds of
anxious listeners repaired to the hills, from which
the cannonading and rattle of musketry could be
distinctly heard. The city waked up to a keen
realization of the horrors of war. All the next day
ambulances brought in the woundedâ€”and open
wagons were laden with the dead. Six thousand
one hundred and thirty-four Confederate soldiers
had been killed; the Federal loss was five thousand
and thirty-one,â€”eleven thousand one hundred and
sixty-five brave men gone from the country that
gave them birth!
</p>

<p>
The streets of Richmond presented a strange
sceneâ€”ambulances of wounded and dying men
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171' href='#Page_171'>171</a></span>
passed companies arriving on their way to the front,
and each cheered the other. Batteries of artillery
thundered through the streets; messengers and
couriers ran hither and thither.
</p>

<p>
The streets were filled with a motley crowd,
citizens hurrying to and fro, negroes running on
messages, newsboys crying "extras" printed on short
slips of the yellow Confederate paper; on one side
of the street regiments arriving from the far South,
cheering as they passed; on the other a train of
ambulances bearing the wounded, the dead, the
dying. Now and then a feeble cheer answered the
strong men going in to win the victory these had
failed to win, but for which they never ceased to
look until death closed the watching eyes.
</p>

<p>
Every house was opened for the wounded. They
lay on verandas, in halls, in drawing-rooms of stately
mansions. Young girls and matrons stood in their
doorways with food and fruit for the marching soldiers,
and then turned to minister to the wounded
men within their doors.
</p>

<p>
It has been estimated that five thousand wounded
men were received in private houses and hospitals
from the field of Seven Pines. The city was
thrilled to its centre. The city had "no language
but a cry"! And yet there was no panic, no frantic
excitement. Only that Richmond, the mirth-loving,
pleasure-seeking, was changed into a city of resolute
men and women, nerved to make any sacrifice for
their cause.
</p>

<p>
At all times during the war the Capitol Square
was a rallying place where men met and received
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172' href='#Page_172'>172</a></span>
news and compared chances of success. They would
sit all day on the hills outside the city and congregate
in the square in the evening to discuss the events
of the day and the probable chances for the morrow.
</p>

<p>
My news of this battle was coupled with the
information that my General had fallen ill from
malarial fever, and had kept up until the army
approached Richmond, but that he was now lying
sick in his tent a few miles from the city.
</p>

<p>
There I found him. It seemed strange to see
the daisies growing all over the ground on which his
little tent was pitched. I obtained leave to move
him at once, and took him to the Spotswood Hotel
in Richmond. "He wants nothing now," said kind
Dr. Dean, "except some buttermilk and good
nursing."
</p>

<p>
The hotel was crowded. President and Mrs.
Davis were there, Mrs. Joseph E. Johnston, Mrs.
Myers, wife of the quartermaster-general, and
many, many more whose names are familiar in all
the war histories. Everybody was on the alert and
on the <i><span lang="la">qui vive</span></i>.
</p>

<p>
From my windows I witnessed the constant arrival
of officers from every division of the army. The
Louisiana Zouaves were an interesting company
of men. Their handsome young French Colonel
Coppens was a fine example of grace and manly
beauty. He would dash up to the door on his
handsome horse, dismount, run up the stairs for a
word with some official, run down again, vault
lightly into his saddle, and gallop down the street.
No one was more admired than Colonel Coppens.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173' href='#Page_173'>173</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I had not visited the drawing-room often before I
became aware that a bitter feud existed between the
three eminent ladies I have mentionedâ€”indeed,
the <i>Richmond Examiner</i> gave a most amusing account
of one of their spicy interviews. Jealousy
and consequent heartburning had possessed the
bosoms of these ladiesâ€”do they not intrude into
every court and camp? And here were court and
camp merged into one. Had I remained idle I
should probably have ranged myself on the side of
my <i><span lang="fr_FR">ci-devant</span></i> commanding officer, Mrs. Johnston;
but matters of tremendous importance soon filled
every mind and heart.
</p>

<p>
This was the last reunion of old Washington
friends we were to enjoy. With some of the
members of the Thirty-sixth Congress we parted
at the Spotswood Hotel to meet no more on earth.
Others met on the battle-field under circumstances
of which they little dreamed when the "state of the
country" was under discussion.
</p>

<p>
One of the warmest secessionists was L. Q. C.
Lamar. His devoted friend, General Pryor, had
parted with him immediately upon the secession of
South Carolina. Their next meeting was at the
battle of Williamsburg. This battle was fought in
the woods, and the danger was enhanced by the
falling boughs of the trees. Behind the shelter of
a stout oak my husband found his old friend Colonel
Lamar. "Oh, Pryor," he exclaimed, as the
shot and shell crashed through the branches,
"what do you think now of the right of peaceable
secession?"

<h2>
CHAPTER XIII
<br />
<span class="s05">THE SEVEN DAYS' BATTLES</span>
</h2>

<p>
The intense heat of June 26th has been noted
in many of the diaries and records of the
day. I remember it because I had feared its
unfavorable effect upon my husband, not yet discharged
by his physicians, and now lying weak and
listless upon his bed at the Spotswood Hotel in
Richmond.
</p>

<p>
I was reading aloud to him the news in the morning
papers, fanning him the while, when a peremptory
knock at the door sent me to my feet. An
ominous-looking note was handed in to "Brigadier-General
Pryor." Upon reading it, my husband
slipped to the side of the bed, and reached out for
his cavalry boots. The note ran: "Dear General,
put yourself <i>at once</i> at the head of your brigade. In
thirty-six hours it will all be over. <span class="smcap">Longstreet</span>."
Before I realized the tremendous import of the order,
he was gone.
</p>

<p>
McClellan was almost at the gates of the city.
The famous "seven days' fight" was about to
begin.
</p>

<p>
Several of the officers of our brigade were in the
hotel, and I ran out to find their wives and learn
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175' href='#Page_175'>175</a></span>
more news from them. On the stair I met Colonel
Scott, and as he passed me, he exclaimed, "No time
until I come back, Madam!" Turning, he paused,
raised his hand, and said solemnly, "If I ever come
back." The wife of Captain Poindexter came up at
the moment. She was weeping, and wringing her
hands. "Do you think," she said, "that we could
drive out to camp and see them once more before
they march?"
</p>

<p>
We hurried into the street, found a carriage, and,
urging our driver to his utmost speed, were soon in
sight of the camp.
</p>

<p>
All was hurry and confusion there. Ambulances
were hitching up, troops forming in line, servants
running hither and thither, horses standing to be
saddled, light army wagons loading with various
camp utensils.
</p>

<p>
Captain Whitner of the General's staff met me,
and said, as he conducted me to my husband's tent:
"The General will be so glad to see you, Madam!
He is lying down to rest a few minutes before we
move."
</p>

<p>
He opened his arms to me as I went in, but there
were no sad words. We spoke cheerily to each
other, but, unable to control myself, I soon ran out
to find John and see that he had provided brandy
and cold tea, the latter a necessity lest good water
should be unprocurable. Never have I seen such
a number of flies! They blackened the land, corrupted
the food, and tormented the nervous horses.
When I returned, Mrs. Poindexter was standing
outside the tent waiting for me. "I can see my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176' href='#Page_176'>176</a></span>
husband only at the head of his company," she
said. "Look! they are forming the line."
</p>

<p>
We stood aside as the brigade formed in marching
order. The stern command, "Fall in! Fall in!"
reached us from company after company stretching
far down the road. My husband mounted his horse,
and, drawing his sword, gave the order to advance.
</p>

<p>
"Head of column to the right!" and with steady
tramp they filed past usâ€”past the only two women,
of the many who loved them, who had known of their
going and had come out to cheer and bless them.
</p>

<p>
We could not bear to remain a moment after they
left. Finding our carriage, we were about to enter,
when the driver pointed back with his whip. There,
sure enough, rose the puffs of blue smoke from
McClellan's gunsâ€”so near, so near!
</p>

<p>
We set our faces homeward, two stunned, tearless
women, neither yet able to comfort the other.
Presently the carriage stopped, and the driver, dismounting,
came to the door.
</p>

<p>
"Lady," said he, "there's a man lying on the
roadside. We just passed him. Maybe he's drunk,
but he 'pears to me to look mighty sick."
</p>

<p>
Fanny Poindexter and I were out of the carriage
in less than a minute, eagerly embracing an opportunity
for actionâ€”the relief for tense feelings.
</p>

<p>
The man wore the uniform of a Confederate
soldier. His eyes were closed. Was he asleep?
We feared the worst when we perceived a thin thread
of blood trickling slowly from a wound in his throat,
and staining his shirt.
</p>

<p>
We knelt beside him, and Fanny gently pressed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177' href='#Page_177'>177</a></span>
her handkerchief upon the wound, whereupon he
opened his eyes, but was unable to speak. "What
in the world are we to do?" said my friend. "We
can't possibly leave him here!"
</p>

<p>
"I can tote him to the carriage," said the kind-hearted
driver. "He ain' no heavy-weight, an' we
can car' 'im to dat hospital jus' at de aidge of
town. Come now, sir! Don't you be feared. I'll
tote you like a baby."
</p>

<p>
We were terrified lest he should die before we
reached the hospital. To avoid jolting, we crawled
at a snail's pace, and great was our relief when we
drew up at the open door of the hospital and summoned
a surgeon. He ordered out a stretcher and
took our patient in, and we waited in a little reception
room until we could learn the verdict after an
examination of his injuries.
</p>

<p>
"It is well for him, poor fellow," said the surgeon
upon returning to report to us, "that you found him
when you did. His wound is not serious, but he
was slowly bleeding to death! Which of you
pressed that handkerchief to it?" I had to acknowledge
that my friend had rendered this service. She
was one of those nervous, teary little women who
could rise to an occasion.
</p>

<p>
"He had probably been sent to the rear after he
was wounded, and had tried to find General Pryor's
camp," said the doctor. "He missed his way, and
went farther than necessary. It has all turned out
right. He is able now to write his nameâ€”'Ernstorff'â€”so
you see he is doing well. When you
pass this way, you must call and see him."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178' href='#Page_178'>178</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We never went that way again. Two years afterward
I was accosted at a railway station by a handsome
young officer who said he "had never
forgotten, never would forget" me. He was
Lieutenant Ernstorff!
</p>

<p>
All the afternoon the dreadful guns shook the
earth and thrilled our souls with horror. I shut
myself in my darkened room. At twilight I had a
note from Governor Letcher, telling me a fierce
battle was raging, and inviting me to come to the
Governor's mansion. From the roof one might
see the flash of musket and artillery.
</p>

<p>
No! I did not wish to see the infernal fires. I
preferred to watch and wait alone in my room.
</p>

<p>
The city was strangely quiet. Everybody had gone
out to the hills to witness the aurora of death to which
we were later to become so accustomed. As it grew
dark a servant entered to light my candles, but I
forbade her. Did I not mean to go to supper?
I would have coffee brought to me. God only
knew what news I might hear before morning. I
must keep up my strength.
</p>

<p>
The night was hot and close. I sat at an open
window, watching for couriers on the street. The
firing ceased about nine o'clock. Surely now somebody
would remember us and come to us.
</p>

<p>
As I leaned on the window-sill with my head on
my arms, I saw two young men walking slowly down
the deserted street. They paused at a closed door
opposite me and sat down upon the low step.
Presently they chanted a mournful strain in a
minor keyâ€”like one of the occasional interludes of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179' href='#Page_179'>179</a></span>
Chopin which reveal so much of dignity in sorrow.
I was powerfully affectedâ€”as I always am by such
musicâ€”and found myself weeping, not for my
own changed life, not for my own sorrows, but for
the dear city; the dear, doomed city, so loved, so
loved!
</p>

<p>
A full moon was rising behind the trees in the
Capitol Square. Soon the city would be flooded
with light, and then!â€”would the invading host
come in to desecrate and destroy? How dear the
city had been to me always! I could remember
when I was a very little child one just such night as
this. The splendor, the immensity of the city had
so oppressed me, coming, as I had come, from the
quiet country, that I could not sleep. Hot and
fevered and afraid, I had risen from my little bed
beside my sleeping mother, and had stolen to the
window to look out. Like to-night there was a
solemn moon in the sky, like to-night an awful
stillness in the city. Just below me a watchman
had called out, "<i>All's well!</i>" Presently the cry
was repeated at a distanceâ€”"All's well!" Fainter
and fainter grew the echo until it became a whisper,
far away in the distant streets. The watchmen were
telling me, I thought, telling all the helpless little
babies and children, all the sick people and old
people, that God was taking care of them; that
"All's well, All's well."
</p>

<p>
Ah! forever gone was the watchman, forever
silent the cry. Never, never again could all be well
with us in old Virginia. Never could we stifle the
memories of this bitter hour. The watchman on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180' href='#Page_180'>180</a></span>
the nation's tower might, some day, mark the
triumphant return of this invading host, and declare,
"All's well,"â€”<i>our</i> hearts would never hear. Too
much blood, too much death, too much anguish!
Our tears would never be able to wash away the
memory of it all.
</p>

<p>
And so the night wore on and I waited and
watched. Before dawn a hurried footstep brought
a message from the battle-field to my door.
</p>

<p>
"The General, Madam, is safe and well. Colonel
Scott has been killed. The General has placed a
guard around his body, and he will be sent here
early to-morrow. The General bids me say he will
not return. The fight will be renewed, and will
continue until the enemy is driven away."
</p>

<p>
My resolution was taken. My children were
safe with their grandmother. I would write. I
would ask that every particle of my household
linen, except a change, should be rolled into bandages,
all my fine linen be sent to me for compresses,
and all forwarded as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
I would enter the new hospital which had been
improvised in Kent &amp; Paine's warehouse, and would
remain there as a nurse as long as the armies were
fighting around Richmond.
</p>

<p>
But the courier was passing on his rounds with
news for others. Presently Fanny Poindexter, in
tears, knocked at my door.
</p>

<p>
"She is bearing it like a brave, Christian woman."
</p>

<p>
"<i>She!</i> Who? Tell me quick."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Scott. I had to tell her. She simply
said, 'I shall see him once more.' The General
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181' href='#Page_181'>181</a></span>
wrote to her from the battle-field and told her how
nobly her husband died,â€”leading his men in the
thick of the fight,â€”and how he had helped to save
the city."
</p>

<p>
Alas, that the city should have needed saving!
What had Mrs. Scott and her children done? Why
should they suffer? Who was to blame for it all?
</p>

<p>
Kent &amp; Paine's warehouse was a large, airy building,
which had, I understood, been offered by the
proprietors for a hospital immediately after the battle
of Seven Pines. McClellan's advance upon Richmond
had heavily taxed the capacity of the hospitals
already established.
</p>

<p>
When I reached the warehouse, early on the morning
after the fight at Mechanicsville, I found cots on
the lower floor already occupied, and other cots in
process of preparation. An aisle between the rows
of narrow beds stretched to the rear of the building.
Broad stairs led to a story above, where other cots
were being laid.
</p>

<p>
The volunteer matron was a beautiful Baltimore
woman, Mrs. Wilson. When I was presented to
her as a candidate for admission, her serene eyes
rested doubtfully upon me for a moment. She hesitated.
Finally she said: "The work is very exacting.
There are so few of us that our nurses must
do anything and everythingâ€”make beds, wait upon
anybody, and often a half a dozen at a time."
</p>

<p>
"I will engage to do all that," I declared, and she
permitted me to go to a desk at the farther end of
the room and enter my name.
</p>

<p>
As I passed by the rows of occupied cots, I saw a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182' href='#Page_182'>182</a></span>
nurse kneeling beside one of them, holding a pan
for a surgeon. The red stump of an amputated arm
was held over it. The next thing I knew I was
myself lying on a cot, and a spray of cold water was
falling over my face. I had fainted. Opening my
eyes, I found the matron standing beside me.
</p>

<p>
"You see it is as I thought. You are unfit for
this work. One of the nurses will conduct you
home."
</p>

<p>
The nurse's assistance was declined, however. I
had given trouble enough for one day, and had only
interrupted those who were really worth something.
</p>

<p>
A night's vigil had been poor preparation for hospital
work. I resolved I would conquer my culpable
weakness. It was all very well,â€”these heroics
in which I indulged, these paroxysms of patriotism,
this adoration of the defenders of my fireside. The
defender in the field had naught to hope from me
in case he should be wounded in my defence.
</p>

<p>
I took myself well in hand. Why had I fainted?
I thought it was because of the sickening, dead odor
in the hospital, mingled with that of acids and disinfectants.
Of course this would always be thereâ€”and
worse, as wounded men filled the rooms. I
provided myself with sal volatile and spirits of camphor,â€”we
wore pockets in our gowns in those days,â€”and
thus armed I presented myself again to Mrs.
Wilson.
</p>

<p>
She was as kind as she was refined and intelligent.
"I will give you a place near the door," she said,
"and you must run out into the air at the first hint
of faintness. You will get over it, see if you don't."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183' href='#Page_183'>183</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Ambulances began to come in and unload at the
door. I soon had occupation enough, and a few
drops of camphor on my handkerchief tided me over
the worst. The wounded men crowded in and sat
patiently waiting their turn. One fine little fellow
of fifteen unrolled a handkerchief from his wrist to
show me his wound. "There's a bullet in there,"
he said proudly. "I'm going to have it cut out,
and then go right back to the fight. Isn't it lucky
it's my left hand?"
</p>

<p>
As the day wore on I became more and more
absorbed in my work. I had, too, the stimulus of
a reproof from Miss Deborah Couch, a brisk, efficient
middle-aged lady, who asked no quarter and
gave none. She was standing beside me a moment,
with a bright tin pan filled with pure water, into
which I foolishly dipped a finger to see if it were
warm; to learn if I would be expected to provide
warm water when I should be called upon to assist
the surgeon.
</p>

<p>
"This water, Madam, was prepared for a raw
wound," said Miss Deborah, sternly. "I must
now make the surgeon wait until I get more."
</p>

<p>
Miss Deborah, in advance of her time, was a germ
theorist. <i>My</i> touch evidently was contaminating.
</p>

<p>
As she charged down the aisle with a pan of water
in her hand, everybody made way. She had known
of my "fine-lady faintness," as she termed it, and I
could see she despised me for it. She had volunteered,
as all the nurses had, and she meant business.
She had no patience with nonsense, and truly
she was worth more than all the rest of us.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184' href='#Page_184'>184</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Where can I get a little ice?" I one day ventured
of Miss Deborah.
</p>

<p>
"Find it," she rejoined, as she rapidly passed on;
but find it I never did. Ice was an unknown
luxury until brought to us later from private houses.
</p>

<p>
But I found myself thoroughly reinstatedâ€”with
surgeons, matron, and Miss Deborahâ€”when I
appeared a few days later, accompanied by a man
bearing a basket of clean, well-rolled bandages, with
promise of more to come. The Petersburg women
had gone to work with a will upon my table-cloths,
sheets, and dimity counterpanesâ€”and even the
chintz furniture covers. My springlike green and
white chintz bandages appeared on many a manly
arm and leg. My fine linen underwear and napkins
were cut, by the sewing circle at the Spotswood,
according to the surgeon's directions, into lengths
two inches wide, then folded two inches, doubling
back and forth in a smaller fold each time, until
they formed pointed wedges for compresses.
</p>

<p>
Such was the sudden and overwhelming demand
for such things, that but for my own and similar
donations of household linen, the wounded men
would have suffered. The war had come upon us
suddenly. Many of our ports were already closed,
and we had no stores laid up for such an emergency.
</p>

<p>
The bloody battle of Gaines's Mill soon followedâ€”then
Frazier's Farm, within the week, and at once
the hospital was filled to overflowing. Every night
a courier brought me tidings of my husband. When
I saw him at the door my heart would die within me!
One morning John came in for certain supplies.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185' href='#Page_185'>185</a></span>
After being reassured as to his master's safety, I
asked, "Did he have a comfortable night, John?"
</p>

<p>
"He sholy did! Marse Roger cert'nly was comfortable
las' night. He slep' on de field 'twixt two
daid horses!"
</p>

<p>
The women who worked in Kent &amp; Paine's hospital
never seemed to weary. After a while the
wise matron assigned us hours, and we went on
duty with the regularity of trained nurses. My
hours were from seven to seven during the day, with
the promise of night service should I be needed.
Efficient, kindly colored women assisted us. Their
motherly manner soothed the prostrate soldier, whom
they always addressed as "son."
</p>

<p>
Many fine young fellows lost their lives for want
of prompt attention. They never murmured. They
would give way to those who seemed to be more
seriously wounded than themselves, and the latter
would recover, while from the slighter wounds gangrene
would supervene from delay. Very few men
ever walked away from that hospital. They died,
or friends found quarters for them in the homes in
Richmond. None complained! Unless a poor man
grew delirious, he never groaned. There was an
atmosphere of gentle kindness, a suppression of emotion
for the sake of others.
</p>

<p>
Every morning the Richmond ladies brought for
our patients such luxuries as could be procured in
that scarce time. The city was in peril, and distant
farmers feared to bring in their fruits and vegetables.
One day a patient-looking middle-aged man said to
me, "What would I not give for a bowl of chicken
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186' href='#Page_186'>186</a></span>
broth like that my mother used to give me when I
was a sick boy!" I perceived one of the angelic
matrons of Richmond at a distance, stooping over
the cots, and found my way to her and said: "Dear
Mrs. Maben, have you a chicken? And could you
send some broth to No. 39?" She promised, and I
returned with her promise to the poor wounded
fellow. He shook his head. "To-morrow will be
too late," he said.
</p>

<p>
I had forgotten the circumstance next day, but at
noon I happened to look toward cot No. 39, and
there was Mrs. Maben herself. She had brought
the chicken broth in a pretty china bowl, with napkin
and silver spoon, and was feeding my doubting
Thomas, to his great satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
It was at this hospital, I have reason to believe,
that the little story originated, which was deemed
good enough to be claimed by other hospitals,
of the young girl who approached a sick man with
a pan of water in her hand and a towel over her
arm.
</p>

<p>
"Mayn't I wash your face?" said the girl, timidly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, lady, you may if you want to," said the
man, wearily. "It has been washed fourteen times
this morning! It can stand another time, I reckon."
</p>

<p>
I discovered that I had not succeeded, despite
many efforts, in winning Miss Deborah. I learned
that she was affronted because I had not shared my
offerings of jelly and fruit with her, for her special
patients. Whenever I ventured to ask a loan from
her, of a pan or a glass for water or the little things
of which we never had enough, she would reply, "I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187' href='#Page_187'>187</a></span>
must keep them for the nurses who understand reciprocity.
Reciprocity is a rule <i>some</i> persons never
seem to comprehend." When this was hammered
into my slow perception, I rose to the occasion. I
turned over the entire contents of a basket the landlord
of the Spotswood had given me to Miss Deborah, and
she made my path straight before me ever afterward.
</p>

<p>
At the end of a week the matron had promoted
me! Instead of carving the fat bacon, to be dispensed
with corn bread, for the hospital dinner, or standing
between two rough men to keep away the flies, or
fetching water, or spreading sheets on cots, I was
assigned to regular duty with one patient.
</p>

<p>
The first of these proved to be young Colonel
Coppens, of my husband's brigade. I could comfort
him very little, for he was wounded past recovery.
I spoke little French, and could only try to
keep him, as far as possible, from annoyance. To
my great relief, place was found for him in a private
family. There he soon diedâ€”the gallant fellow I
had admired on his horse a few months before.
</p>

<p>
Then I was placed beside the cot of Mr. (or Captain)
Boyd of Mecklenburg, and was admonished by
the matron not to leave him alone. He was the most
patient sufferer in the world, gentle, courteous, always
considerate, never complaining. I observed he often
closed his eyes and sighed. "Are you in pain, Captain?"
"No, no," he would say gently. One day,
when I returned from my "rest," I found the matron
sitting beside him. Tears were running down her
cheeks. She motioned me to take her place, and
then added, "No, no, I will not leave him."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188' href='#Page_188'>188</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Captain's eyes were closed, and he sighed wearily
at intervals. Presently he whispered slowly:â€”
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"There everlasting spring abides,"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
then sighed, and seemed to sleep for a moment.
</p>

<p>
The matron felt his pulse and raised a warning
hand. The sick man's whisper went on:â€”
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Bright fields beyond the swelling flood</p>
<p>Standâ€”dressedâ€”in living green."</p>
</div></div>

<p>
The surgeon stood at the foot of the cot and
shook his head. The nurses gathered around with
tearful eyes. Presently in clear tones:â€”
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Not Jordan's streamâ€”nor death's cold flood</p>
<p>Shall fright usâ€”fromâ€”the shore,"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
and in a moment more the Christian soldier had
crossed the river and lain down to rest under the
trees.
</p>

<p>
Each of the battles of those seven days brought
a harvest of wounded to our hospital. I used
to veil myself closely as I walked to and from my
hotel, that I might shut out the dreadful sights
in the street,â€”the squads of prisoners, and, worst
of all, the open wagons in which the dead were
piled. Once I <i>did</i> see one of these dreadful wagons!
In it a stiff arm was raised, and shook as it was
driven down the street, as though the dead owner
appealed to Heaven for vengeance; a horrible sight
never to be forgotten.
</p>

<p>
After one of the bloody battlesâ€”I know not if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189' href='#Page_189'>189</a></span>
it was Gaines's Mill or Frazier's Farm or Malvern
Hillâ€”a splendid young officer, Colonel Brokenborough,
was taken to our hospital, shot almost to
pieces. He was borne up the stairs and placed in a
cotâ€”his broken limbs in supports swinging from
the ceiling. The wife of General Mahone and I
were permitted to assist in nursing him. A young
soldier from the camp was detailed to help us, and
a clergyman was in constant attendance, coming at
night that we might rest. Our patient held a court
in his corner of the hospital. Such a dear, gallant,
cheery fellow, handsome, and with a grand air even
as he lay prostrate! Nobody ever heard him complain.
He would welcome us in the morning with
the brightest smile. His aide said, "He watches
the head of the stairs and calls up that look for
your benefit." "Oh," he said one day, "you can't
guess what's going to happen! Some ladies have
been here and left all these roses, and cologne,
and such; and somebody has sentâ€”champagne!
We are going to have a party!"
</p>

<p>
Ah, but we knew he was very ill! We were bidden
to watch him every minute and not be deceived
by his own spirits. Mrs. Mahone spent her life
hunting for ice. My constant care was to keep his
canteenâ€”to which he clung with affectionâ€”filled
with fresh water from a spring not far away, and I
learned to give it to him so well that I allowed no
one to lift his head for his drink during my hours.
</p>

<p>
One day, when we were alone, I was fanning him,
and thought he was asleep. He said gravely, "Mrs.
Pryor, beyond that curtain they hung up yesterday
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' name='Page_190' href='#Page_190'>190</a></span>
poor young Mitchell is lying! They think I don't
know! But I heard when they brought him in,â€”as
I lie here, I listen to his breathing. I haven't
heard it now for some time. Would you mind seeing
if he is all right?"
</p>

<p>
I passed behind the curtain. The young soldier
was dead. His wide-open eyes seemed to meet
mine in mute appeal. I had never seen or touched
a dead man, but I laid my hands upon his eyelids
and closed them. I was standing thus when his
nurse, a young volunteer like myself, came to me.
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't do that," she said; "I went for the
doctor. I'm so glad you could do it."
</p>

<p>
When I returned Colonel Brokenborough asked
no questions and I knew that his keen senses had
already instructed him.
</p>

<p>
To be cheerful and uncomplaining was the unwritten
law of our hospital. No bad news was ever
mentioned, no foreboding or anxiety. Mrs. Mahone
was one day standing beside Colonel Brokenborough
when a messenger from the front suddenly
announced that General Mahone had received a
flesh-wound. Commanding herself instantly, she
exclaimed merrily: "<i>Flesh</i>-wound! Now you all
know that is <i>just impossible</i>." The General had no
flesh! He was as thin and attenuated as he was
brave.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-216" id="i-216"></a>
<img src="images/i-216.jpg" width="550" height="353" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MALVERN HILL.</p>
</div>

<p>
As Colonel Brokenborough grew weaker I felt
self-reproach that no one had offered to write letters
for him. His friend the clergyman had said to me:
"That poor boy is engaged to a lovely young girl.
I wonder what is best? Would it grieve him to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191' href='#Page_191'>191</a></span>
speak of her? You ladies have so much tact; you
might bear it in mind. An opportunity might offer
for you to discover how he feels about it." The
next time I was alone with him I ventured: "Now,
Colonel, one mustn't forget absent friends, you
know, even if fair ladies do bring perfumes and
roses and what not. I have some ink and paper
here. Shall I write a letter for you? Tell me what
to say."
</p>

<p>
He turned his head and with a half-amused smile
of perfect intelligence looked at me for a long time.
Then an upward look of infinite tenderness; but
the message was never sentâ€”never needed from a
true heart like his.
</p>

<p>
One night I was awakened from my first sleep
by a knock at my door, and a summons to "come
to Colonel Brokenborough." When I reached his
bedside I found the surgeon, the clergyman, and
the Colonel's aide. The patient was unconscious;
the end was near. We sat in silence. Once, when
he stirred, I slipped my hand under his head, and
put his canteen once more to his lips. After a long
time his breathing simply ceased, with no evidence
of pain. We waited awhile, and then the young
soldier who had been detailed to nurse him rose,
crossed the room, and, stooping over, kissed me
on my forehead, and went out to his duty in the
ranks.
</p>

<p>
Two weeks later I was in my room, resting after a
hard day, when a haggard officer, covered with mud
and dust, entered. It was my husband.
</p>

<p>
"My men are all dead," he said, with anguish,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192' href='#Page_192'>192</a></span>
and, falling across the bed, he gave vent to the passionate
grief of his heart.
</p>

<p>
Thousands of Confederate soldiers were killed,
thousands wounded.
</p>

<p>
Richmond was saved!
</p>

<p>
General McClellan and General Lee both realized
that their men needed rest. My husband was
allowed a few days' respite from duty. Almost without
pause he had fought the battles of Williamsburg,
Seven Pines, Mechanicsville, Gaines's Mill,
and Frazier's Farm. He had won his promotion
early, but he had lost the loved commander who
appreciated him, had seen old schoolmates and
friends fall by his side,â€”the dear fellow, George
Loyal Gordon, who had been his best man at
our wedding,â€”old college comrades, valued old
neighbors.
</p>

<p>
Opposed to him in battle, then and after, were
men who in after years avowed themselves his warm
friends,â€”General Hancock, General Slocum, General
Butterfield, General Sickles, General Fitz-John
Porter, General McClellan, and General Grant.
They had fought loyally under opposing banners,
and from time to time, as the war went on, one and
another had been defeated; but over all, and through
all, their allegiance had been given to a banner that
has never surrendered,â€”the standard of the universal
brotherhood of all true men.

<h2>
CHAPTER XIV
<br />
<span class="s05">THE WINTER OF 1861</span>
</h2>

<p>
The privilege of nursing in the hospital had
been bought at a dear price, for it was
decided positively that I was to surrender,
for the present, my dream of following the army.
I was remanded to the mountains, and at Charlottesville
I had news of the events that rapidly followed
the Seven Days' Battles around Richmond.
</p>

<p>
McClellan had been relieved of his command,
and the defenceless women and children of Northern
Virginia were handed over to the tender mercies
of General Pope. McClellan wrote, August 8: "I
will strike square in the teeth of all the infamous
orders of Mr. John Pope, and forbid all pillaging
and stealing, and take the highest Christian ground
for the conduct of the war. I will not permit this
army to degenerate into a mob of thieves, nor will I
return these men of mine to their families as a set
of wicked and demoralized robbers."
</p>

<p>
General Pope had announced his purpose (which
he carried out) to subsist his army on our country,
and to hang or shoot any non-combating citizens
who might fall into his hands, in retaliation for the
killing of his soldiers. This was one of "the infamous
orders of Mr. John Pope" to which General
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194' href='#Page_194'>194</a></span>
McClellan alluded; but infamy to some eyes is
fame to others. Pope superseded McClellan; but
he was himself superseded after his defeat at the
hands of Lee, and McClellan reinstated.
</p>

<p>
My husband's brigade followed General Lee,
fought the battle of Manassas, where he captured
and paroled the hospital corps, went with him
throughout the campaign, into Maryland and back,
fought the battle of South Mountain and the bloody
battle of Antietam (or Sharpsburg).
</p>

<p>
The histories of these battles have been given
again and again by the military commanders who
conducted them. At the close of the campaign
General Lee reported that his men were in the
finest possible conditionâ€”only there were too few
of them. As the Federal armies were depleted, they
could be reÃ«nforced by foreigners. As our men were
lost, we had no fresh troops to take their places.
</p>

<p>
My husband commanded Anderson's division at
Antietam, General Anderson having been wounded.
This battle is quoted, along with the battle of Seven
Pines, as one of the most hotly contested of the war.
Sorely pressed at one time, General Pryor despatched
an orderly to General Longstreet with a request for
artillery. The latter tore the margin from a newspaper
and wrote: "I am sending you the guns,
dear General. This is a hard fight and we had better
all die than lose it." At one time during the battle
the combatants agreed upon a brief cessation, that
the dead and wounded of both sides might be removed.
While General Pryor waited, a Federal
officer approached him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195' href='#Page_195'>195</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"General," said he, "I have just detected one of
my men in robbing the body of one of your soldiers.
I have taken his booty from him, and now consign
it to you."
</p>

<p>
Without examining the small bundle,â€”tied in a
handkerchief,â€”my husband ordered it to be properly
enclosed and sent to me. The handkerchief contained
a gold watch, a pair of gold sleeve-links, a few
pieces of silver, and a strip of paper on which was
written, "Strike till the last armed foe expires," and
signed "A Florida patriot." There seemed to be
no clew by which I might hope to find an inheritor
for these treasures. I could only take care of them.
</p>

<p>
I brought them forth one day to interest an aged
relative, whose chair was placed in a sunny window.
"I think, my dear," she said, "there are pin-scratched
letters on the inside of these sleeve-buttons." Sure
enough, there were three initials, rudely made, but
perfectly plain.
</p>

<p>
Long afterward I met a Confederate officer from
Florida who had fought at Antietam.
</p>

<p>
"Did you know any one from your state, Captain,
who was killed at Sharpsburg?"
</p>

<p>
"Alas! yes," he replied, and mentioned a name
corresponding exactly with the scratched initials.
</p>

<p>
The parcel, with a letter from me, was sent to an
address he gave me, and in due time I received a
most touching letter of thanks from the mother of
the dead soldier.
</p>

<p>
General Lee went into winter quarters at Culpeper,
and thither I repaired to visit a kind and
hospitable family, who were good enough to invite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196' href='#Page_196'>196</a></span>
me. In their home I spent two weeks. I had not
imagined there were so many soldiers in the world
as I saw then. "You cannot take a step anywhere,"
said a lady, "without treading on a soldier!" They
were in the finest spirits, notwithstanding their long
marches and short rations. Thousands on thousands
of Federal troops were in Virginia. The highways
of our chief rivers were closed, our railroads
menaced. Everything we needed was already
scarce and held at high prices. Nobody had comforts
or luxuries; nobody murmured because of
such privations.
</p>

<p>
We made our host's drawing-room a camping
ground, his fire our camp-fire. Around it
gathered a nightly crowd of gay young soldiers.
They wished no serious talk, these young warriors!
They had a brief respite from fatigue and sorrow,
and they intended to enjoy it. They sentimentalized,
however, over the tender and mournful song,
"Lorena," which even then touched a chord in
every heart, and which meant so much of devotion
and heartbreak two years later. For four years the
daughters of the South waited for their lovers, and
some, alas! waited forever.
</p>

<p>
With pretty Nelly at the piano, her blue eyes
raised to heaven, and Jack Fleming accompanying
her on her guitar, his dark eyes raised to Nelly, the
effect was overwhelming; and lest somebody should
quite finish us by singing, "Flee as a bird to the
mountain," we would hasten to demand the "Bonnie
Blue Flag," or "Dixie," or the polite invitation to
"Joe Hooker" to "come out the Wilderness," or,
better still, a good story. The latter call would
bring many we had heard beforeâ€”there are so few
good stories in the worldâ€”but we would welcome
each one with applause, even if it were no better
than the story of Captain â€”â€” (I can't remember the
captain's name) and his black boy "CÃ¦sar." I can
only vouch for the story, which ran thus:â€”
</p>

<p>
The captain, going into a skirmish one day, left
his tent and its contents in the care of the boy.
"Mayn't I go he'p de cook?" said CÃ¦sar, much
desiring to place himself farther in the rear.
</p>

<p>
"Stay here, sir, and protect my property!"
sternly commanded his master.
</p>

<p>
CÃ¦sar, when left alone, grew unhappy, and when
straggling shot fell like hail around the tent, he
incontinently fled and hid in the bushes. When he
returned, he found an angry captain indeed.
</p>

<p>
"You rascal! Didn't I leave you here to
protect my property? It might have been all
stolen."
</p>

<p>
"I knows it, sah, I knows it! An' I did purtect
yo' property, sah! I sholy did! Dem ole cloes
ain' wuth nothin'! I'se feared to bresh 'em less'n I
git a hole in 'em; but <i>dis</i> property," laying his hand
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198' href='#Page_198'>198</a></span>
proudly on his breast, "<i>dis</i> property is wuth fifteen
hundred dollars!"
</p>

<p>
Of course so good a story was soon capped by
another. One of the boys who had been with my
General at Williamsburg could tell it. A shell had
entered the domain of pots and kettles and created
what Domingo the cook termed a "clatteration."
He at once started for the rear.
</p>

<p>
"What's de matter, Mingo?" asked a fellow-servant,
"whar you gwine wid such a hurrification?"
</p>

<p>
"I gwine to git out o' troubleâ€”dar whar I
gwine. Dar's too much powder in dem big things.
Dis chile ain't gwine bu'n hisself! An' dar's dem
Minnie bullets, too, comin' frew de a'r, singin':
'<i>Whar</i>â€”isâ€”you? <i>Whar</i>â€”isâ€”you?' I ain't
gwine stop an' tell 'em whar I is! I'se a twenty-two-hundurd-dollar
nigger, an' I'se gwine tek keer
o' what b'longs to marster, I is."
</p>

<p>
Of course we heard again the story of Stonewall
Jackson's body-servant, who always knew before
anybody when a battle was imminent.
</p>

<p>
"The General tells you, I suppose," said one of
the soldiers.
</p>

<p>
"Lawd, no, sir! De Gin'ral nuvver tell <i>me</i>
nothin'! I observates de 'tention of de Gin'ral dis
way: co'se he prays, jest like we all, mornin' an'
night; but when he gits up two, three times in a
night to pray, den I rubs my eye and gits up too,
an' packs de haversack,â€”ca'se I done fine out
dere's gwine to be de ole boy to pay right away."
</p>

<p>
Amusing as were the negro stories, there were
plenty of others, revealing the peculiar characteristics
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199' href='#Page_199'>199</a></span>
of the common soldier. The soldier from rural
districts was a trial to his officers in the early days
of the war. Nothing could make him hurry. "If
he came to a stream, he would deliberately look
around for two fence-rails and put them across, and
the time consumed by a company in crossing in this
way can be imagined. If his feet hurt him, he would
sit down on the roadside to tie rags around them."
He never could be made to understand that freedom
of speech with an officer, who had been perhaps a
neighbor, was denied him; nor yet that he could
not indulge in good-natured chaff or criticism.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sentinel here?" asked an officer, who
found a sentry sitting down and cleaning his gun,
having taken it entirely to pieces.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am a sort of sentinel, I reckon."
</p>

<p>
"Well, <i>I</i> am a sort of officer of the day."
</p>

<p>
"Is <i>that</i> so? Just hold on till I get my gun
together, and I will give you a sort of a salute."<a name='FA_16' id='FA_16' href='#FN_16' class='fnanchor'>[16]</a>
</p>

<p>
When a picket guard at Harper's Ferry was being
detailed for duty, one of these verdant volunteers
loudly protested against that manner of carrying on
war.
</p>

<p>
"What's the use of gwine out thar to keep everybody
off?" he shouted. "We've all kem here to
hev a fight with them Yankees, an' ef you sen'
fellers out thar to skeer 'em off, how in thunder are
we gwine to hev a scrimmage?"
</p>

<p>
In the hardest times of starvation and weariness,
according to our soldier boys, the situation would be
relieved by the drollery of some good-natured, great-hearted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200' href='#Page_200'>200</a></span>
countryman. Officers who had an easy
place, and musicians, for a similar reason, were their
special targets. Rather than be tormented, musicians
would often leave the line of march and go
through fields to avoid the running fire. "Ah,
now! give us a toot on yer old funnel," or, "Brace
up thar with yer blowpipe!"
</p>

<p>
These fellows who didn't fight were all classed
under the general term of "bomb-proofs." One of
these officersâ€”a little manâ€”having appeared in
an enormous pair of cavalry boots, ran the gantlet
of a neighboring brigade and heard a frank opinion
of himself:â€”
</p>

<p>
"I say, Mister, better git out'r them smokestacks!
We know you're in thar 'cause we all kin see yer
head stickin' out. You needn' say yer <i>ain't</i> in thar,â€”'cause
yer ears is workin' powerful."
</p>

<p>
The allusion to the celebrated long-eared animal
was awful!
</p>

<p>
If a "bomb-proof" officerâ€”a fellow who had a
position in the rearâ€”should happen to be smartly
dressed when cantering along near a regiment, he
would be apt to change his canter to a gallop as the
men would shout and whoop:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Oh, <i>my</i>! Ain't he pooty? Say, Mister! whar'd
ye git that biled shut? Was ye ra-a-ly born so, or
was ye put together by corntrack? Sich a nice-lookin'
rooster oughter git down an' scratch for a
wurrum!"
</p>

<p>
Even when a brigade would pass at double-quick,
going into a battle in which the waiting soldier
expected any moment to take part, the latter would
call out:â€”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201' href='#Page_201'>201</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"What's your hurry, boys? Gwine to ketch a
train?"
</p>

<p>
They made great fun, too, of their own fears,
never considering them worthy of being treated seriously,
or as in any way detrimental.
</p>

<p>
Under fire at Manassas, a raw recruit was doing
pretty well, when a rabbit loped across the field.
Dropping his gun as he was about to shoot, he
yelled, with honest pathos:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Go it, little cotton-tail, go it! I'm jest as
skeered as you be, an' ef I dar'd, I'd run too."
</p>

<p>
A number of militia having given way under fire,
their commanding officer called out to one of the
fugitives:â€”
</p>

<p>
"What are you running away for, you â€”â€” â€”â€”
coward? You ought to be ashamed of yourself."
</p>

<p>
"I ain't runnin' away, Gin'ral! I'm just skeered!
Them fellers over thar are shootin' bullets as big as
watermillions! One of 'em went right peerst my
headâ€”right peerst;â€”an'â€”an' I wants to go
home."
</p>

<p>
"Well, why didn't you shoot back, sir? You are
crying like a baby."
</p>

<p>
"I knows it, Gin'ralâ€”I knows it. I wish I <i>was</i>
a baby, and a gal-baby, too, and then I wouldn't hev
been cornscripted."
</p>

<p>
The regiments of Georgia, North Carolina, and
Virginia could never pass each other without some
chaffing challenge.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, North Car'lina," said an officer to a lanky
specimen in a shabby uniform.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Virginia."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202' href='#Page_202'>202</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Blockade on turpentine making? You all hard
up? No sale for tar now?"
</p>

<p>
"Wellâ€”yes!" was the slow rejoinder. "We sell
all our tar to Jeff Davis now."
</p>

<p>
"The thunder you do! What does the President
want with your tar?"
</p>

<p>
"He puts it on the heels of Virginians to make
'em stick to the battle-field."
</p>

<p>
The staff officer rode on.
</p>

<p>
A good story had found its way into our lines from
a Federal officer. He was commenting upon the fact
that all Southern women were intense rebelsâ€”with
one exception. He had been with others marching
down a wooded lane which ended in a sharp curve.
As they rounded it, they suddenly came upon a
house, before which was a woman picking up chips.
As she had evidently not seen them, the officer tiptoed
up to her, put his arm around her waist, and
kissed herâ€”and stepped back to avoid the box on
the ear he knew he deserved. The woman, however,
straightened herself, looked at him seriously for a
moment, and said slowly, "You'll find me right
here every mornin' a-pickin' up chips."
</p>

<p>
It would seem that the telling of stories of a mildly
humorous nature, with the characteristic of dialect,
was a feature of the war-time,â€”the President of the
United States affording a notable example. When
the gravest matters were under consideration, all things
were held in abeyance until the illustrative anecdote
was duly presented. How Mr. Seward chafed under
them we all know. The poor little stories that went
the rounds among the rank and file at the camp-fires
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203' href='#Page_203'>203</a></span>
in Virginia had their uses. Whatever the weariness,
the discouragement, the failure of the wagons to come
up with provisions, by such simple means did the
brave boys lighten their own and each others' hearts.
Whenever they had cards they played; but before
going into battle the camp-ground would be strewn
with them, the soldier of the rank and file always
emptying his pockets of his cards! His Testament
was pocketed in their stead.
</p>

<p>
In repeating these stories around our blazing log
fire, and in describing their marches and hard times,
the brave fellows made sport of all their discomforts
and of their shifts to supplement deficiencies. They
told with merriment of the times they had proudly
drawn over their bruised feet boots found on the
march, and had suffered such agony from the swelling
of the compressed members that they were fain
to implore a comrade to cut off the instrument of
torture; of the time Mr. Giddings and his pretty
daughters entertained them in Maryland, and of their
dreadful embarrassment at finding they had ravenously
swept the table of every biscuit, every bit of
ham, every raw tomatoâ€”and had wanted, oh, so
much more! And how some of them had been captured
and soon released; but while prisoners and waiting
for a train, how a Federal officer had talked most
kindly to them, inquiring for old West Point comrades
of his who were on our side; and how they on
their part had asked after the welfare of Captain John
Lea of Petersburg, who had been captured at Williamsburg,â€”to
be told by this Federal officer that
Captain Lea had been dreadfully wounded, and while
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204' href='#Page_204'>204</a></span>
in the hospital had been nursed by a young lady with
whom he fell in love, and that the officer had been
present at their marriage in Williamsburg, and through
his intercession and that of other old West Point comrades
Captain Lea had been released. When the
time came for parting with the courteous officer our
boys had respectfully requested his name. "My name
is Custer," he said. "I do not belong to any regiment,
but am on the staff of General McClellan."
He was none other than the famous George A.
Custer of the United States cavalry, destined to
win for himself immortal renown, and to meet gallantly
an early death in the fight with the Indians
on the Little Big Horn River.
</p>

<p>
Many of these soldier boysâ€”"boys" now no
longer, but "veterans"â€”were from Petersburg, and
had stood in line on the day when Alice and Tabb
and Marian and Molly and all the other girls had
waited with me to see them off. It was delightful to
meet them and to hear news of the others. Where
was Will Johnson? Where was Berry Stainback?
Will had been captured "for no reason whatever
except that he and Berry had but one blanket between
them, and Will had to get himself captured
when he found Berry had been, in order to continue
to share the blanket, which was in Berry's possession,"
a story which Will's friends could safely invent
for their amusement, as his known courage was beyond
all doubt.
</p>

<p>
General "Jeb" Stuart was a great hero with these
soldier boys, dashing as he did all over the country
with his eight thousand mounted men. He was our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205' href='#Page_205'>205</a></span>
plumed knightâ€”with his gold star and long feather.
They never wearied of stories of his promptness, his
celerity, his meteorlike dashes.
</p>

<p>
"They'll never catch him!" said one proudly.
"They'll always reach the place where he recently
was."
</p>

<p>
"He reminds me of the knights of the olden
time," said a young lady.
</p>

<p>
"The mediÃ¦val knight, my dear young lady,"
said General Johnson, "would be of little use in
this war. He would have stood no chance with one
of Stuart's men."
</p>

<p>
"Fancy him," said another, "with his two hundred
weight of iron on him, and as much on his big
cart-horse. Imagine him, armed with a maul or a
lance, a battle-axe, and six-foot pole, going into a
fight at Manassas or Antietam."
</p>

<p>
"He would never get there," said the General.
"A light cavalryman of the First Virginia would
have ridden around King Arthur or Sir Launcelot
half a dozen times while the knight was bracing
himself up for action; and the Chicopee sabre would
have searched out the joints under his chin, or his
arm, or his sword-belt, and would have shucked him
like an oyster before he could get his lance in rest."
</p>

<p>
And Jackson was another of their idols. Stories
of his strategy, his courage, his faith in God, his successes,
filled many an hour around the camp-fire in
the hospitable Culpeper mansion.
</p>

<p>
But the chief idol of their heartsâ€”of all our
heartsâ€”was our beloved commander, our Bayard
<i><span lang="fr_FR">sans peur et sans reproche</span></i>, General Lee. The hand
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206' href='#Page_206'>206</a></span>
instinctively sought the cap at the mention of his
name. Indignant comments were made upon the
newspaper criticisms of his early misfortunes in the
western part of Virginia in the autumn of 1861, and
one occasion was remembered when, his own attention
having been directed to a fierce newspaper attack, as
unjust in its conclusions as it was untrue in its statements,
he was asked why he silently suffered such
unwarranted aspersions; and he had calmly replied
that, while it was very hard to bear, it was perhaps
quite natural that such hasty conclusions should be
announced, and that it was better not to attempt a
justification or defence, but to go steadily on in the
discharge of duty to the best of our ability, leaving
all else to the calmer judgment of the future and to
a kind Providence.
</p>

<p>
Happy was the private soldier who had seen General
Lee, thrice happy the one who had spoken to him.
Of the latter, a plain countryman, having listened to
the personal incidents of his fellows, as they related
various occasions when they had been noticed by
General Lee, was fired by a desire to emulate them,
and confided that he, too, had once enjoyed a very
interesting and gratifying interview with General
Lee. Importuned to tell it, the soldier modestly
hesitated, but urged by an evident incredulity on
the part of his hearers, he took heart of grace and
related as follows:â€”
</p>

<p>
"I was jest out of the horspittle an' was natchelly
strollin' round when the scrimmage was goin' on,
and I saw Gen'ral Lee on a little rise not fur off.
I santered closer an' closer to him, and when I saw
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207' href='#Page_207'>207</a></span>
him look at me I says, 'Pretty warm work over thar,
Gen'ral.' He give me a keen look, an' says he,
quiet-like: 'Where do you belong? Where's your
regiment?' An' I says, 'I'm lookin' for my regiment
nowâ€”Twelfth Virginia.' 'I can help you,'
says he; 'there is your regiment just going into the
fight. Hurry up an' join it.' An' I run off proud
as a pigeon."
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you think you might get shot?" asked
his comrade.
</p>

<p>
"I suttenly did! I always thinks that. But
then, thinks I, Gen'ral Lee will be mighty sorry
'cause he knowed he sent me into danger when I
was feelin' mighty weak an' poly."
</p>

<p>
The incidents were many which the officers and
soldiers could remember, illustrating the dear commander's
peculiar traits. His aide, Colonel Taylor,
has written me of one most touching incident:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Tidings reached General Lee, soon after his
return to Virginia, of the serious illness of one of his
daughtersâ€”the darling of his flock. For several
days apprehensions were entertained that the next
intelligence would be of her death. One morning
the mail was received, and the private letters were
distributed as was the custom; but no one knew
whether any home news had been received by the
General. At the usual hour he summoned me to
his presence, to know if there were any matters of
army routine upon which his judgment and action
were desired. The papers containing a few such
cases were presented to him; he reviewed, and gave
his orders in regard to them. I then left him, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208' href='#Page_208'>208</a></span>
for some cause returned in a few moments, and with
my accustomed freedom entered his tent without
announcement or ceremony, when I was startled and
shocked to see him overcome with grief, an open
letter in his hand. That letter contained the sad
intelligence of his daughter's death.
</p>

<p>
"Scarcely less to be admired than his sublime
devotion to duty," continued Colonel Taylor, "was
his remarkable self-control. General Lee was
naturally of a positive temperament, and of strong
passions; and it is a mistake to suppose him otherwise;
but he held these in complete subjection to
his will and conscience. He was not one of those
invariably amiable men, whose temper is never
ruffled; but when we consider the immense burden
which rested upon him, and the numberless causes
for annoyance with which he had to contend, the
occasional cropping out of temper which we, who
were constantly near him, witnessed, only showed
how great was his habitual self-command.
</p>

<p>
"He had a great dislike to reviewing army communications;
this was so thoroughly appreciated by
me that I would never present a paper for his action
unless it was of decided importance, and of a nature
to demand his judgment and decision. On one
occasion, when an audience had not been asked of
him for several days, it became necessary to have
one. The few papers requiring his action were submitted.
He was not in a very pleasant mood;
something irritated him, and he manifested his ill
humor by a little nervous twist or jerk of the neck
and head, peculiar to himself, accompanied by some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209' href='#Page_209'>209</a></span>
harshness of manner. This was perceived by me,
and I hastily concluded that my efforts to save him
annoyance were not appreciated. In disposing of
some case of a vexatious character, matters reached
a climax; he became really worried, and, forgetting
what was due to my superior, I petulantly threw the
paper down at my side and gave evident signs of
anger. Then, in a perfectly calm and measured
tone of voice, he said, 'Colonel Taylor, when I lose
my temper, don't you let it make you angry.'
</p>

<p>
"Was there ever a more gentle and considerate,
and yet so positive, reproof? How magnanimous
in the great soldier, and yet how crushing to the
subordinate! The rash and disrespectful conduct
of the latter would have justified, if it did not
demand, summary treatment at the hands of the
former. Instead of this, the first man of his day
and generation, great and glorious in his humility,
condescended to occupy the same plane with his
youthful subaltern, and to reason with him as an
equal, frankly acknowledging his own imperfections,
but kindly reminding the inferior at the same time
of his duty and his position." Great indeed must
be the man whom we can love all the better for his
human weakness.

CHAPTER XV
<br />
<span class="s05">GUARDING THE BLACKWATER</span>
</h2>

<p>
General Pryor's brigade had been composed
of regiments from Alabama, Florida,
Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia.
Congress having recommended that regiments should
be enlisted under officers from their own states,â€”in
order to remedy, if possible, the disinclination to reÃ«nlist
for the war,â€”there was a general upheaval and
change throughout the entire army during the autumn
of 1862. On the 10th of November General Pryor
was ordered to report for duty to Major-General
G. W. Smith, commanding at Richmond, Virginia, the
Second, Fifth, and Eighth Florida Regiments of his
brigade being assigned to a Florida brigadier, the
Fourteenth Alabama and the Fifth North Carolina
to officers from their respective states.
</p>

<p>
On November 2 General Longstreet had written
to General Pryor: "I understand that General Perry
will have the Florida regiments. Please make some
suggestion as to what arrangement we may be able
to make for you."
</p>

<p>
Accordingly my husband consulted General Lee,
and received the following letter from him, dated
November 25, 1862:â€”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211' href='#Page_211'>211</a></span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">General</span>: Your letter of the 23d inst. has just been
received. I regret my inability to detach from this army
the two regiments to operate on the Blackwater. As far
as I am able to judge, troops are more wanted here than
there, and it might be better to bring the troops which it
is contemplated to unite with those in question to this
army. I regretted at the time the breaking up of your
former brigade, but you are aware that the circumstances
which produced it were beyond my control. I hope it will
not be long before you will be again in the field, that the
country may derive the benefit of your zeal and activity."
</p>
</div>  <!-- blockquot -->

<p>
On November 29, General Pryor was ordered by
General G. W. Smith to report to Major-General
French, and was personally introduced to the latter
by the following letter:â€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter_head">
"<span class="smcap">Richmond</span>, November 29, 1862.
</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">My dear General</span>: This will be handed you by
my friend, Brigadier-General Pryor. General Pryor's brigade
in General Lee's army was recently broken up in
rearranging the brigades by states. It is intended by the
government that he shall have a Virginia brigade as soon as
one can be formed for him. In the meanwhile, it is General
Lee's desire that General Pryor shall serve upon the
Blackwaterâ€”his own section of the countryâ€”and he
directs that the two regiments of cavalry on the Blackwater
be placed under his command, etc....
</p>

<p>
"General Pryor has already won for himself the reputation
of being one of the best, most daring, and energetic
officers in the army, highly distinguished in civil life, and
one of the most influential men in the state, especially in
his own section. He will coÃ¶perate with you thoroughly,
and I am sure will render good service to the cause and be
of great assistance to yourself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212' href='#Page_212'>212</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I am satisfied, from what General Lee writes me, that at
present we can have no troops from his army. The impression
is, that a great battle is impending in the vicinity
of Fredericksburg. We must keep our house in order, and
make the most of the means we have and can procure from
other sources than General Lee's army.

<p>
A rule enforced for the common good often falls
heavily upon individuals. General Pryor grieved to
lose his men, and they united in many petitions to
be allowed to remain with him. He undertook the
protection of the Blackwater region with an inadequate
force, in the certain expectation that reÃ«nforcements
would be sent to him.
</p>

<p>
The enemy destined to conquer us at lastâ€”the
"ravenous, hunger-starved wolf"â€”already menaced
us. General Longstreet had learned that corn
and bacon were stored in the northeastern counties
of North Carolina, and he had sent two companies
of cavalry on a foraging expedition, to the region
around Suffolk.
</p>

<p>
"The Confederate lines," says a historian, "extended
only to the Blackwater River on the east,
where a body of Confederate troops was stationed to
keep the enemy in check." That body was commanded
by General Pryor, now in front of a large
Federal force, to keep it in check while the wagon-trains
sent off corn and bacon for Lee's army. This
was accomplished by sleepless vigilance on the part
of the Confederate General. The Federal forces
made frequent sallies from Suffolk, but were always
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_213' name='Page_213' href='#Page_213'>213</a></span>
driven back with heavy loss. It is amusing to read
of the calmness with which his commanding officers
ordered him to accomplish great things with his
small force.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot," says General Colston, "forward your
requisition for two regiments of infantry and one of
cavalry: it is almost useless to make such requisitions,
for they remain unanswered. You must use
every possible means to deceive the enemy as to
your strength, and you must <i>hold the line of the
Blackwater to the last extremity</i>."
</p>

<p>
General French writes: "If I had any way to
increase your forces, I should do so, but I have to
bow to higher authority and the necessities of the
service. But you must annoy the villains all you
can, and make them uncomfortable. Give them no
rest. Ambush them at every turn."
</p>

<p>
General Pryor did not dream I would come to his
camp at Blackwater. He supposed I would find
quarters among my friends at home, but I had now
no home. Our venerable father had sent his family
to the interior after the battles around Richmond;
had given up his church in Petersburg, and, commending
the women, old men, and children to the
care of a successor, had entered the army as chaplain,
"where," as he said, "I can follow my own church
members and comfort them in sickness, if I can do
no more."
</p>

<p>
As soon as the position of our brigade was made
known to me, I drew forth the box containing the
camp outfit, packed a trunk or two, and took the
cars for the Blackwater. The terminus of the railroad
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214' href='#Page_214'>214</a></span>
was only a few miles from our camp. The
Confederate train could go no farther because of the
enemy. The day's journey was long, for the passenger
car attached to the transportation train was
dependent upon the movements of the latter. The
few passengers who had set forth with me in the
morning had left at various wayside stations, and
I was now alone. I had no idea where we should
sleep that night. I thought I would manage it
somehowâ€”somewhere.
</p>

<p>
We arrived at twilight at the end of our journey.
When I left the car my little boys gathered around
me. There was a small wooden building near, which
served for waiting-room and post-office. The only
dwelling in sight was another small house, surrounded
by a few bare trees. My first impression was that I
had never before seen such an expanse of gray sky.
The face of the earth was a dead, bare level, as far
as the eye could reach; and much, very much of
it lay under water. I was in the region of swamps,
stretching on and on until they culminated in the
one great "Dismal Swamp" of the country. No
sounds were to be heard, no hum of industry or
lowing of cattle, but a mighty concert rose from
thousands, nay, millions, of frogs.
</p>

<p>
"Now," thought I, "here is really a fine opportunity
to be 'jolly'! Mark Tapley's swamps
couldn't surpass these." But all the railroad folk were
departing, and the postmaster was preparing to lock
his door and leave also. I liked the looks of the
little man, and ventured:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Can you tell me, sir, where I can get lodging
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215' href='#Page_215'>215</a></span>
to-night? I am the General's wifeâ€”Mrs. Pryorâ€”and
to-morrow he will take care of me. I know he
has no place for us in camp."
</p>

<p>
The little man considered, and looked us overâ€”a
lady, three little boys, trunks, and a box.
</p>

<p>
"I can take thee in myself," he said. "I am just
going home."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thank you, thank you. I shall need only
the smallest trunk to-night."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I can hardly make thee comfortable,
as I live alone, but thee is welcome."
</p>

<p>
"Thee"! Oh, joy! I thought. This is a blessed
little Quaker! We'll not part again! Here I rest.
We soon reached his door, and he called out for
"Charity!"
</p>

<p>
The call was answered in person by a black girl in
a short linsey-woolsey frock which revealed her ankles
and bare feet, her hair tied in innumerable little tails,
sticking all over her head like a porcupine's quills.
She was the most alert little creature I ever saw,
nimble-footed and quick. "Charity," said my host,
"have a good fire made upstairs in the front room
at once. Thee is welcome," he repeated, turning to
me, and I followed the sable maiden up the stair.
</p>

<p>
"And so your name is Charity?"
</p>

<p>
"Charity's meh name an' Charity's meh naycher,"
she informed me. She soon brought in Dick with an
armful of wood, and a fine, welcome fire cheered us.
</p>

<p>
"You needn' be lookin' at de baid," said Charity.
"I'll soon sheet it. He's got sto's o' quilts, but I
dunno as he'll s'render 'em."
</p>

<p>
It appeared that he would. He brought them, an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216' href='#Page_216'>216</a></span>
armful, himself, and the bright patchwork on our two
beds looked very inviting.
</p>

<p>
Charity leaned against the mantel, regarding me
with leisurely scrutiny, her bare feet crossed one over
the other. I felt it to be the part of prudence to
placate her.
</p>

<p>
"We'll unlock the trunk," I said,â€”Dick had
already fetched it,â€”"and I'll find a pretty ribbon
for you."
</p>

<p>
"I knowed," said the girl, "you was some punkins
soon's I sot eyes on you." Before I was summoned
to the supper of biscuit, fried bacon, and coffee without
cream, Charity had enlightened me about her
employer; she made haste to tell me he was not
her master. "I'se free, I is! Mo'n dat, he's a
Quaker, an' ef you ever seen Quakers, you knows
dey don' like no slaves 'roun'. Yas'm, I'se freeâ€”an'
Dick, he's a po'-white boy. Me'n him does
all de wuk cep'n in hawg-killin' time, an' den de
fokes comes fum de quarters to he'p."
</p>

<p>
"Are you lonesome?" I asked, making conversation.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Dat</i> I is. You see he los' his wife two mont'
ago. Dese here quilts is hern. She made 'em."
</p>

<p>
"Dear me," I said, "I'm so sorry!"
</p>

<p>
But Charity had broken down and was sobbing
with her head against the mantel.
</p>

<p>
"Yas'm! I cert'nly is lonesum! She jes up an'
die, an', an' de po' little baby daid too."
</p>

<p>
As I lay in bed I thought of the dear dead
woman. I resolved to be nothing but a comfort
to Charity and that little Quaker. I made plans for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217' href='#Page_217'>217</a></span>
the happiness of both. With my heart full of sympathy,
full of gratitude, full of hope, I slept sweetly
and long.
</p>

<p>
In the morning a message sent from the post-office
through an inquirer from the camp brought me my
General; brought, too, an invitation from my host to
make this house his headquarters, and during the day
he moved over bag and baggage. A cook was detailed
from the camp, we were to furnish our own table;
and our kind host looked so deeply wounded when
we offered rent for our lodgings, that no more
was said on that subject. I had brought nothing
with me except the plain contents of my camp chest.
The thick white china of the table was unattractive,
and I consulted Charity about the possibility of buying
something better. Our only market-town, Suffolk,
was in the hands of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
"He's got painted cups an' saucers, but I dunno's
he'll s'render 'em," said Charity.
</p>

<p>
"Suppose you ask him!"
</p>

<p>
"I dun try 'im once. I ax 'im dat time when his
mother-in-law cum to see 'imâ€”an' he nuvver say
nuthin! Den I let 'im rip!"
</p>

<p>
But after a few days "he" threw in my lap a
bunch of keys, saying simply, "Everything in the
house and on the plantation belongs to thee."
Some of them were enormous, like the key of the
Bastile, and all were rusted. I selected a small one,
returning the rest, and in Charity's presence unlocked
the old mahogany sideboard and counted to
her the cups, saucers, and plates, gilt-edged, and
decorated with a rosebud here and there.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218' href='#Page_218'>218</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Good Gawd!" said Charity. "I <i>nuvver</i> thought
he'd s'render the chany cups!"
</p>

<p>
"Not one is to be broken," I said, sternly. "If
you break one, tell me at once and bring me the
pieces, so I can send to Richmond and replace it."
</p>

<p>
I saw but little of my kind host. He lived at
the post-office, remaining late every night to open
the mail and have it ready for an early morning delivery
to the camp, and returning home at twelve
o'clock to sleep. Every night thereafter he found a
bright fire, a clean-swept hearth, and on plates before
the fire, biscuits, sausage or broiled ham, and
a little pot of coffee. A tableâ€”with a lamp and
the latest papersâ€”was drawn up beside his arm-chair.
</p>

<p>
A few months after I left his house for Petersburg
I received the following letter from him:â€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"<span class="smcap">Respected Friend</span>: I have now married. I couldn't
stand it.
</p>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="l8">"Thy friend,</span><br />
"I. P."
</p>
</div> <!-- /blockquot -->

<p>
Since then I have always counselled, as cure for
an incorrigible bachelor, simply to take care of him
beautifully for three months and thenâ€”leave him!
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-246" id="i-246"></a>
<img src="images/i-246.jpg" width="315" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">HON. ROGER A. PRYOR.<br />
<span class="s08"><i>From a photograph, about 1870.</i></span></p>
</div>

<p>
But to return: Charity's example was contagious.
"I cert'nly was lonesum" on the Blackwater. The
General and his staff were forever in the saddle.
When he returned after his skirmishes and exploring
expeditions, he was too tired to amuse me. I busied
myself teaching the little boys and dispensing the
provisions our men brought me. Bacon and biscuit,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219' href='#Page_219'>219</a></span>
without butter, fruit, or milk, was deadly diet for me,
so I was allowed an occasional courier from the
camp to take my money and scour the country for
better fare. When he appeared, galloping down the
lane, on his return, he looked like some extraordinary
feathered creature with a horse's head, so completely
were both covered with turkeys, ducks, geese,
and chickens. Then would ensue a gift to the
camp hospital of soups and stews and a fine supper
for my General's staff, Major Shepard, Captain
Whitner, Major Keiley, and Captain McCann,
with as many choice spirits from the officers as we
could entertain. Then was brewed, by the majors
and captains aforesaid, a mighty bowl of egg-nog,
sweet and very stiff, for there was no milk to temper
its strength. I feared at first that my Quaker host
might disapprove, but I never failed to find the
foaming glass I placed beside his night lamp quite
empty next morning.
</p>

<p>
I could manage to occupy myself during the day.
I could make a study of Charity, in whom I soon
perceived quite an interesting character, quick to
learn, responsive, and most affectionate. She was
literally my only female companion. I had no
neighbors, nowhere to drive (the enemy was only
fifteen miles off) except on the watery lanes, nothing
to meet when driving except, perhaps, a slow-moving
cart drawn by steeds like Sydney Smith's "Tug-and-Lug,
Haul-and-Crawl," driven by a negro boy, who
stood with feet planted on the shafts and who entertained
his patient, long-suffering oxen by telling them
of the torments awaiting them unless they would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220' href='#Page_220'>220</a></span>
"go along." But the long and lonely evenings
were hard to bear, when the general and his staff
were abroad, roaming like watch-dogs around the
frontier, deluding the enemy by a great show of
bravado here and there. Nothing like the orchestra
of frogs can be imagined. They serenaded the
moon all night long; a magnificent diapason of
mighty voices, high soprano, full baritone, and
heavy bass. I could understand the desperate need
of the lone woman who had once lived here. The
patchwork quilts were eloquent witnesses.
</p>

<p>
As the time dragged on in this lonely place, I
began to find that I wanted many articles classed in
a woman's mind generally as "things."
</p>

<p>
There is not a more generous word in the
English language than "things." It may mean,
according to Stormonth, "A Swedish assize of
justice, a Norwegian parliament, a meeting for
palaver on public affairs, luggage, or clothes,"â€”which
proves how important is the making of new
dictionaries as we travel along toward our highest
civilization. For instance: when you say to your
butler, "Be careful with the breakfast things," he
understands you perfectly. He knows you mean
the egg-shell cups, and blossomy plates. When
you bid your maid bring your "things," she appears
with your hat, gloves, cloak, and furs. "Her rooms
are comfortable, but I don't like her things," you
say when the <i><span lang="fr_FR">bric-Ã -brac</span></i> and curios are not to your
taste. "I never speak of such things," you declare
in haughty superiority when some guest has filled
an hour with foolish or injurious gossip. "Such
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221' href='#Page_221'>221</a></span>
things are beneath contempt," says the lawyer of
certain practices familiar in the courts. And then
we have "poor thing,"â€”not the traditional robin
who "hides his head under his wing, poor thing,"
but some fine lady, far from young andâ€”unmarried!
And "a poor thing, sir, but mine own,"â€”this time
not a fine lady by any means, only "an ill-favored
virgin."
</p>

<p>
And then, having vexed our souls all the week
over mundane "things," we are given, on Sunday,
glimpses of another world quite as full of them.
</p>

<p>
"Wean yourselves from earthly idols and fix
your hearts on heavenly things," says the bishop.
Things! Heavenly things! Stars, harps, crowns
of righteousness, high and lofty aspirations!
</p>

<p>
Not long after the battle of Fredericksburg a
participator described the panic, the horror, the
fleeing of the women and children from their homes.
"And then," he said, "there arose from that homeless,
stricken crowd of women a cry of mortal agony,
'<i>My things! Oh, my things!</i>'"
</p>

<p>
"Things" to me meant only needful garments.
I could starve with perfect serenity. I could live
without the latest novel, the late magazines, egg-shell
china, rich attire, jewels; but I had not had
a new bonnet for three years. Shoes, and above
all shoestrings, were needed by my little boys,
needles, tapes, sewing thread and sewing silk, stays
and staylaces, gloves, combs. Of course I needed
garments of muslin and linen. Had I not rolled
bandages of mine? I needed gowns. A calico
dress now cost $40. But these large "things"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222' href='#Page_222'>222</a></span>
were quite beyond all hope on the Blackwater.
Smaller articles I might, perhaps, compass. The
General's orders, however, strictly forbade the purchase
by private individuals of articles smuggled
through the lines. He once confiscated a sloop on
the Blackwater laden with women's shoes, slippers,
and Congress gaiters! He would not allow me a
shoe; all were sent to Richmond to be sold for the
benefit of the government. Communication with
the enemy must be discouraged lest he discover our
weakness.
</p>

<p>
I knew that most of the tight little carts peddling
fish, potatoes, and eggs had double bottoms between
which were all sorts of delightful things, but I never
dared approach the pedler on the subject; and as
I was the commanding officer's wife, he dared not
approach me.
</p>

<p>
One day I was in an ambulance, driving on one
of the interminable lanes of the region, the only
incident being the watery crossing over the "cosin,"
as the driver called the swamps that had been
"Poquosin" in the Indian tongue. Behind me
came a jolting two-wheeled cart, drawn by a mule
and driven by a small negro boy, who stood in front
with a foot planted firmly upon each of the shafts.
Within, and completely filling the vehicle, which
was nothing more than a box on wheels, sat a
dignified-looking woman. The dame of the ambulance
at once became fascinated by a small basket of
sweet potatoes which the dame of the cart carried in
her lap.
</p>

<p>
With a view to acquiring these treasures I essayed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223' href='#Page_223'>223</a></span>
a tentative conversation upon the weather, the prospects
of a late spring, and finally the scarcity of
provisions and consequent suffering of the soldiers.
</p>

<p>
After a keen glance of scrutiny the market
woman exclaimed, "Well, I am doing all I can
for them! I know you won't speak of it! Look
here!"
</p>

<p>
Lifting the edge of her hooped petticoat, she
revealed a roll of army cloth, several pairs of cavalry
boots, a roll of crimson flannel, packages of gilt braid
and sewing silk, cans of preserved meats, a bag of
coffee! She was on her way to our own camp,
right under the General's nose! Of course I should
not betray herâ€”I promised. I did more. Before
we parted she had drawn forth a little memorandum
book and had taken a list of my own necessities.
She did not "run the blockade" herself. She had
an agentâ€”"a dear, good Suffolk man"â€”who
would fill my order on his next trip.
</p>

<p>
It isn't worth while to tell men everything. They
are not supposed to be interested in the needle-and-thread
ways of women!
</p>

<p>
About three weeks after my interview with the
blockade-runner, I was driving again in the ambulance.
Suddenly Captain Whitner, who had galloped
to overtake me, wheeled in front of the horses and
stopped them.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Captain! Any news at camp
I am permitted to learn?"
</p>

<p>
I perceived the corners of his mouth twitching,
but he said gravely:â€”
</p>

<p>
"I am commissioned to tell you that you must
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224' href='#Page_224'>224</a></span>
consider yourself under arrest. I am sent to discharge
this painful duty and conduct you to camp."
</p>

<p>
"By whose order, pray?"
</p>

<p>
"Official orders from headquarters," and he presented
a paper.
</p>

<p>
I knew he must be acting a part for his own
amusement, and I asked no questions. I would
not gratify him by seeming to be alarmed.
</p>

<p>
When I arrived at my husband's tent, I found
him with Major Shepard, and a wretched-looking
countryman standing near them. I comprehended
the situation at a glance and resolved to play my
part.
</p>

<p>
"This prisoner," said the General, "has been
arrested for bringing in contraband goods in violation
of express orders. He pleads that the goods
were ordered by the General's wife for the use of
the General's family. Have you anything to say to
show cause why he should not be punished?"
</p>

<p>
"May it please the court," I said, turning to
Major Shepard and Captain Whitner, "I call you
to witness that I invited you last week to partake
of a bowl of egg-nog, telling you it was made of
contraband French brandy. When the commanding
officer's attention was called to the fact, he said
he could do nothing; he was obliged to submit
because I was his superior officer, that I outranked
him everywhere except on the march and the battle-field."
</p>

<p>
A burst of laughter interrupted me. The chairman
called for order.
</p>

<p>
"I confess that I deputed this estimable gentleman
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225' href='#Page_225'>225</a></span>
to procure some sewing silk for the mending
of the garments of my subordinate officer. I had
hoped that through his valor the blockade would, ere
this, have been raised. Finding myself mistakenâ€”"
</p>

<p>
"The prisoner is discharged," said the General,â€”I
uttered an exclamation of triumph,â€”"but," he
added, "the goods are confiscated for the benefit of
the Confederate government, and are already on the
way to Richmond."
</p>

<p>
I was very sorry for the fright the poor man had
suffered for my sake. I took him home with me
beside the driver on the ambulance. Of course I
paid him. I had one piece of family silver with me
for which I had no use on the Blackwater,â€”a butter
knifeâ€”and I gave it to him as a souvenir of his
happy escape from danger.
</p>

<p>
How did I manage without my needles and
thread?
</p>

<p>
Charity came to me early one morning with a
brown paper parcel in her arms.
</p>

<p>
"Dat ole creeter," said Charity, "what come
home wid you las' week, knock at de kitchen do'
fo' day dis mornin'. He gimme dis, an' say you
bleeged to git it fo' de Gen'al wake up; an'â€”an'â€”he
sayâ€”but Lawd! 'tain' wuf while to tell you what
he say! But he <i>do</i> say to tell you to gimme sumpin
out'n de bundle. Gawd knows I ain' no cravin' po'-white-folks'
nigger, but dat what he say."
</p>

<p>
I need not give an inventory of the contents of
the bundle. They were perfectly satisfactory to meâ€”and
to Charity.
</p>

<p>
We had slender mails on the Blackwater, few
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226' href='#Page_226'>226</a></span>
papers, no books. Occasionally a letter from Agnes
gave me news of the outside world.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter_head">

copy of Victor Hugo's last novel, "<span lang="fr_FR">Les MisÃ©rables</span>," reprinted

I have cried my eyes out over Fantine and Cosette and

"Fantine." I've worlds of news to tell you. Alice

a stitch of clothes? There is not a bonnet for sale in
Richmond. Some of the girls smuggle them, which I for
one consider in the worst possible taste, to say the least.
We have no right at this time to dress better than our
neighbors, and besides, the soldiers need every cent of our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227' href='#Page_227'>227</a></span>
money. Do you remember in Washington my pearl-gray
silk bonnet, trimmed inside with lilies of the valley? I
have ripped it up, washed and ironed it, dyed the lilies blue
(they are bluebells now), and it is very becoming. All
the girls intend to plait hats next summer when the wheat
ripens, for they have no blocks on which to press the coal-scuttle
bonnets, and after all when our blockade is raised
we may find they are not at all worn, while hats are hats
and never go out of fashion. The country girls made
them last summer and pressed the crowns over bowls and
tin pails. I could make lovely paper flowers if I had
materials.

"It seems rather volatile to discuss such things while
our dear country is in such peril. Heaven knows I would
costume myself in coffee-bags if that would help, but having
no coffee, where could I get the bags? I'll e'en go
afield next summer, and while Boaz is at the front, Ruth
will steal his sheaves for her adornment.

a great crowd of negroes is passing through the streets, singing
as they march. They have been working on the fortifications
north of the city, and are now going to work on
them south of us. They don't seem to concern themselves
much about Mr. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation,
and they seem to have no desire to do any of the fighting.

The Emancipation Proclamation did not create a
ripple of excitement among the colored members of
our households in Virginia. Of its effect elsewhere
I could not judge. As to fighting, our own negroes
never dreamed of such a thing. The colored troops
of the North were not inferior, we were told, in
discipline and courage to other soldiers; but the
martial spirit among them had its exceptions. A
Northern writer has recorded an interview with a
negro who had run the blockade and entered the
service of a Federal officer. He was met on board
a steamer, after the battle of Fort Donelson, on his
way to a new situation, and questioned in regard to
his experience of war.<a name='FA_17' id='FA_17' href='#FN_17' class='fnanchor'>[17]</a>

<p>
Towards the last of January we had a season of
warm, humid weather. Apparently the winter was
over; the grass was springing on the swamp, green
and luxurious, and the willows swelling into bud.
There were no singing birds on the Blackwater as
early as January 28, but the frogs were mightily
exercised upon the coming of spring, and their
nightly concerts took on a jubilant note.
</p>

<p>
One day I had a few moments' conversation with
my husband about army affairs, and he remarked
that our Southern soldiers were always restless
unless they were in action. "They never can stand
still in battle," he said; "they are willing to yell
and charge the most desperate positions, but if they
can't move forward, they must move backward.
Stand still they cannot."
</p>

<p>
I thought I could perceive symptoms of restlessness
on the part of their commander. Often in the
middle of the night he would summon John, mount
him, and send him to camp, a short distance away;
and presently I would hear the tramp, tramp of the
General's staff officers, coming to hold a council of
war in his bedroom. On the 28th of January he
confided to me that on the next day he would make a
sally in the direction of the enemy. "He is getting
entirely too impudent," said he; "I'm not strong
enough to drive him out of the country, but he
must keep his place."
</p>

<p>
I had just received a present of coffee. This was at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231' href='#Page_231'>231</a></span>
once roasted and ground. On the day of the
march, fires were kindled under the great pots used
at the "hog-killing time" (an era in the household)
and many gallons of coffee were prepared.
This was sweetened, and when our men paused near
the house to form the line of march, the servants
and little boys passed down the line with buckets of
the steaming coffee, cups, dippers, and gourds.
Every soldier had a good draught of comfort and
cheer. The weather had suddenly changed. The
great snow-storm that fell in a few days was gathering,
the skies were lowering, and the horizon was
dark and threatening.
</p>

<p>
After the men had marched away, I drove to the
hospital tent and put myself at the disposal of the
surgeon. We inspected the store of bandages and
lint, and I was intrusted with the preparation of
more.
</p>

<p>
"I ain' got no use for dis stuff," said my one
female friend and companion, Charity, whom I pressed
into service to help me pick lint. "'Pears like 'tain't
good for nuthin' but to line a bird's nes'."
</p>

<p>
"It will be soft for the wound of a soldier," I
said, "after he has fought the Yankees."
</p>

<p>
"I'll pick den; I'll tar up my onlies' apun ef he'll
kill one."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Charity!"
</p>

<p>
"Yas'm, I will dat! Huccome we all don' drive
'm out o' Suffolk? Der's lodes an lodes o' shoes
an' stockin's, an' sugar an' cawfy in Suffolk! An'
dese nasty Abolition Yankees got 'em all!"
</p>

<p>
"Those are not proper words for you to use," I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232' href='#Page_232'>232</a></span>
said. "What have you against the Northern
people? They never did you harm."
</p>

<p>
"Dey ain't, ain't dey?" she replied, with feeling.
"Huccome I'se got to go barfooted? Hit's scan'lous
for a free gal to go barfooted, like she was so
no 'count she couldn't git a par o' shoes fer herse'f."
</p>

<p>
"I'll ask the General to order a pair for you."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" said Charity, scornfully; "you can't
do nothin' wid dat Gen'al. Ain' I hear you baig
an' baig 'im for a par o' slippers dat time he fristricated
de boatload full? I ain' seen you git de
slippers."
</p>

<p>
Charity was not the only one of the Nation's
Wards who held the enemy in contempt. The
special terms in which she designated them were in
common use at the time. She had often heard them
from the General's servant, John, who shared the
opinions of the common soldier. Some of the expressions
of the great men I knew in Washington
were quite as offensive and not a bit less inelegant,
although framed in better English. I never approved
of "calling names," I had seen what comes
of it; and I reproved John for teaching them to
my little boys.
</p>

<p>
"No'm," said John, "I won't say nothin'; I'll
just say the Yankees are mighty mean folks."
</p>

<p>
My first news from the General was cheering,
but he would not return for a day or two. He
must fly about the frontier a little in various directions
to let the enemy know he was holding his own.
His official report was as follows:â€”

</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">General</span>: This morning at 4 o'clock the enemy under
Major-General Peck attacked me at Kelly's store, eight
miles from Suffolk. After three hours' severe fighting we
repulsed them at all points and held the field. Their force

thousand. My loss in killed and wounded will not exceed
fiftyâ€”no prisoners. I regret that Col. Poage is among
the killed. We inflicted a heavy loss on the enemy.

"<span class="smcap">Roger A. Pryor</span>, <i>Brigadier-General Commanding</i>."
</p>
</div> <!-- /blockquot -->

<p>
On February 2 the General thus addressed his
troops: "The Brigadier-General congratulates the
troops of this command on the results of the recent
combat.
</p>

<p>
"The enemy endeavored under cover of night to
steal an inglorious victory by surprise, but he found
us prepared at every point, and despite his superior
numbers, greater than your own, in the proportion
of five to one, he was signally repulsed and compelled
to leave us in possession of the field.
</p>

<p>
"After silencing his guns and dispersing his
infantry, you remained on the field from night until
one o'clock, awaiting the renewal of the attack, but
he did not again venture to encounter your terrible
fire.
</p>

<p>
"When the disparity of force between the parties
is considered, with the proximity of the enemy to
his stronghold, and his facilities of reÃ«nforcements by
railway, the result of the action of the 30th will be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234' href='#Page_234'>234</a></span>
accepted as a splendid illustration of your courage
and good conduct."
</p>

<p>
One of the "enemy's" papers declared that our
force was "three regiments of infantry, fourteen
pieces of artillery, and about nine hundred cavalry."
</p>

<p>
The temptation to "lie under a mistake" was
great in those days of possible disaffection, when
soldiers had to believe in their cause in order to
defend it. One of the newspaper correspondents of
the enemy explained why we were not again attacked
after the first fight. He said: "Some may inquire
why we did not march forthwith to Carrsville and
attack the rebels again. The reasons are obvious.
Had he went [<i><span lang="la">sic</span></i>] to Carrsville Pryor would have
had the advantage to cut off our retreat. The
natives know every bypath and blind road through
the woods and are ever ready to help the rebels to
our detriment. Pryor can always cross the Blackwater
on his floating bridge. It is prudent to allow
an enemy to get well away from his stronghold the
better to capture his guns and destroy his ammunition,"
etc.
</p>

<p>
Another paper declares he was heavily reÃ«nforced
at Carrsville.
</p>

<p>
Another records: "The rebels have been very
bold in this neighborhood. Pryor has been in the
habit of crossing the Blackwater River whenever he
wanted to. Our attacking him this time must have
been a real surprise to him. We took a large
number of prisoners!"
</p>

<p>
He continued the indulgence of this habit until
spring, receiving from his countrymen unstinted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235' href='#Page_235'>235</a></span>
praise for his protection of that part of our state.
While he could not utterly rout the invading army,
he "held them very uneasy."
</p>

<p>
I was made rich by enthusiastic congratulations
from our capital and from Petersburg. Agnes
wrote from Richmond:â€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Have you seen the <i>Enquirer</i>? Of course this is very
grand for you because this is your own little fightâ€”all by
yourself. In Richmond everybody says the General is to
be promoted Major-General. When he is, I shall attach
myself permanently to his staff. The life of inglorious
idleness here is perfectly awful. If you suppose I don't
long for a rich experience, you are mistaken. Give me
the <i>whole</i> of itâ€”victory, defeat, glory and misfortune,
praise and even censure (so it be <i><span lang="fr_FR">en plein air</span></i>)â€”anything,
everything, except stolid, purposeless, hopeless uselessness.
</p>

<p>
"The worst effect of this inaction is felt in this city,
where we can manufacture nothing for the soldiers, and
only consume in idleness what they need. A sort of
court is still kept up hereâ€”but the wives of our great
generals are conspicuous for their absence. Mrs. Lee is
never seen at receptions. She and her daughters spend
their time knitting and sewing for the soldiers, just as her
great-grandmother, Martha Washington, did in '76; and
General Lee writes that these things are needed. People
here, having abundant time to find fault, do not hesitate to
say that our court ladies assume too much state for
revolutionary times. They had better be careful! We
won't guillotine themâ€”at least not on the block (there
are other guillotines), but it would be lovelier if they
could realize their fine opportunities. Think of Florence
Nightingale! Mrs. Davis is very chary of the time she
allots us. If King Solomon were to call with the Queen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236' href='#Page_236'>236</a></span>
of Sheba on his arm the fraction of a moment after the
closing minute of her reception, he would not be admitted!
I can just see you saying, in that superior manner you see
fit to assume with me:â€”
</p>

<p>
"'But, Agnes dear! that is good form, you know, and
belongs to the etiquette of polite life.'
</p>

<p>
"Of course I know it! Did I say that Mrs. Davis
should admit King Solomon? <i>I</i> wouldn't! I only tell
you what other folks think and sayâ€”but <i>ajew</i>, until I hear
some more news and gossip.

CHAPTER XVI
<br />
<span class="s05">VICISSITUDES OF THE WAR</span>
</h2>

<p>
My friend Agnes could soon record graver
things than idleness or gossip. On April
4, 1863, she wrote from Richmond:â€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"<span class="smcap">My Dear</span>: I hope you appreciate the fact that you
are herewith honored with a letter written in royal-red ink
upon sumptuous gilt-edged paper. There is not, at the
present writing, one inch of paper for sale in the capital
of the Confederacy, at all within the humble means of the
wife of a Confederate officer. Well is it for herâ€”and I
hope for youâ€”that her youthful admirers were few, and
so her gorgeous cream-and-gold album was only half filled
with tender effusions. Out come the blank leaves, to be
divided between her friend and her Colonel. Don't be
alarmed at the color of the writing. I have not yet dipped
my goose-quill (there are no steel pens) in the 'ruddy drops
that visit my sad heart,' nor yet into good orthodox red ink.
There are fine oaks in the country, and that noble tree
bears a gall-nut filled with crimson sap. One lies on my
table, and into its sanguinary heart I plunge my pen.
</p>

<p>
"Something very sad has just happened in Richmondâ€”something
that makes me ashamed of all my jeremiads over
the loss of the petty comforts and conveniences of lifeâ€”hats,
bonnets, gowns, stationery, books, magazines, dainty
food. Since the weather has been so pleasant, I have been
in the habit of walking in the Capitol Square before breakfast
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238' href='#Page_238'>238</a></span>
every morning. Somehow nothing so sets me up after
a restless night as a glimpse of the dandelions waking up
from their dewy bed and the songs of the birds in the Park.
Yesterday, upon arriving, I found within the gates a crowd
of women and boysâ€”several hundreds of them, standing
quietly together. I sat on a bench near, and one of the
number left the rest and took the seat beside me. She was
a pale, emaciated girl, not more than eighteen, with a sunbonnet
on her head, and dressed in a clean calico gown.
'I could stand no longer,' she explained. As I made room
for her, I observed that she had delicate features and large
eyes. Her hair and dress were neat. As she raised her
hand to remove her sunbonnet and use it for a fan, her
loose calico sleeve slipped up, and revealed the mere skeleton
of an arm. She perceived my expression as I looked at it,
and hastily pulled down her sleeve with a short laugh.
'This is all that's left of me!' she said. 'It seems real
funny, don't it?' Evidently she had been a pretty girlâ€”a
dressmaker's apprentice, I judged from her chafed forefinger
and a certain skill in the lines of her gown. I was
encouraged to ask: 'What is it? Is there some celebration?'
</p>

<p>
"'There <i>is</i>,' said the girl, solemnly; 'we celebrate our
right to live. We are starving. As soon as enough of us
get together we are going to the bakeries and each of us
will take a loaf of bread. That is little enough for the
government to give us after it has taken all our men.'
</p>

<p>
"Just then a fat old black Mammy waddled up the walk
to overtake a beautiful child who was running before her.
'Come dis a way, honey,' she called, 'don't go nigh dem
people,' adding, in a lower tone, 'I's feared you'll ketch
somethin' fum dem po'-white folks. I <i>wonder</i> dey lets 'em
into de Park.'
</p>

<p>
"The girl turned to me with a wan smile, and as she rose
to join the long line that had now formed and was moving,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239' href='#Page_239'>239</a></span>
she said simply, 'Good-by! I'm going to get something to
eat!'
</p>

<p>
"'And I devoutly hope you'll get itâ€”and plenty of it,'
I told her. The crowd now rapidly increased, and numbered,
I am sure, more than a thousand women and children.
It grew and grew until it reached the dignity of a
mobâ€”a bread riot. They impressed all the light carts
they met, and marched along silently and in order. They
marched through Cary Street and Main, visiting the stores
of the speculators and emptying them of their contents.
Governor Letcher sent the mayor to read the Riot Act,
and as this had no effect he threatened to fire on the crowd.
The city battalion then came up. The women fell back
with frightened eyes, but did not obey the order to disperse.
The President then appeared, ascended a dray, and addressed
them. It is said he was received at first with hisses from
the boys, but after he had spoken some little time with
great kindness and sympathy, the women quietly moved on,
taking their food with them. General Elzey and General
Winder wished to call troops from the camps to 'suppress
the women,' but Mr. Seddon, wise man, declined to issue
the order. While I write women and children are still
standing in the streets, demanding food, and the government
is issuing to them rations of rice.
</p>

<p>
"This is a frightful state of things. I am telling you of
it because <i>not one word</i> has been said in the newspapers about
it. All will be changed, Judge Campbell tells me, if we can
win a battle or two (but, oh, at what a price!), and regain
the control of our railroads. Your General has been magnificent.
He has fed Lee's army all winterâ€”I wish he
could feed our starving women and children.

</p>
</div>  <!-- /blockquot -->

<p>
My good Agnes reckoned without her host when
she supposed General Pryor would be rewarded for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240' href='#Page_240'>240</a></span>
his splendid service on the Blackwater. He had
never ceased all winter to remind the Secretary of
War of his promise to give him a permanent command.
He now felt that he had earned it. He
had fought many battles, acquitting himself with
distinction in all,â€”Williamsburg, Seven Pines,
Mechanicsville, Gaines's Mill, Frazier's Farm, the
Second Manassas, and Sharpsburg, besides the fight
on the Blackwater.
</p>

<p>
He now wrote, April 6, 1863, an almost passionate
appeal to the President himself, imploring
that he be sent into active service, and not be "denied
participation in the struggles that are soon to determine
the destinies of my country. If I know
myself," he added, "it is not the vanity of command
that moves me to this appeal. A single and
sincere wish to contribute somewhat to the success
of our cause impels me to entreat that I may be
assigned to duty. That my position is not the
consequence of any default of mine you will be
satisfied by the enclosed letter from General Lee."
The letter was followed by new promises. It was
supplemented by General Pryor's fellow-officers,
who not only urged that the country should not lose
his services, but designated certain regiments which
might easily be assigned to him. The President
wrote courteous letters in reply, always repeating
assurances of esteem, etc. The <i>Richmond Examiner</i>
and other papers now began to notice the matter
and present General Pryor as arrayed with the party
against the administration. This, being untrue, he
contradicted. On March 17, 1863, the President
wrote to him the following:â€”

<p>
Among the letters sent to Mr. Davis in General
Pryor's behalf was one from General Lee and one
from General Jackson, both of which unhappily
remained in the President's possession, no copies
having been kept by General Pryor.
</p>

<p>
As time went on, my husband waited with such
patience as he could command. Finally he resigned
his commission as brigadier-general, and also his seat
in Congress, and entered General Fitz Lee's cavalry
as a private soldier. His resignation was held a long
time by the President "in the hope it would be
reconsidered," and repeatedly General Pryor was
"assured of the President's esteem," etc. General
Jackson, General Longstreet, General A. P. Hill,
General D. H. Hill, General Wilcox, General George
Pickett, General Beauregard, were all his friends.
Some of them had, like General Johnston and General
McClellan, similar experience. It was a bitter
hour for me when my General followed me to the
Amelia Springs with news that he had entered the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_242' name='Page_242' href='#Page_242'>242</a></span>
cavalry as a private. "Stay with me and the
children," I implored.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said; "I had something to do with
bringing on this war. I must give myself to Virginia.
She needs the help of all her sons. If there
are too many brigadier-generals in the service,â€”it
may be so,â€”certain it is there are not enough private
soldiers."
</p>

<p>
The Divinity that "rules our ends, rough hew
them as we may," was guiding him. I look back
with gratitude to these circumstances,â€”then so hard
to bear,â€”circumstances to which, I am persuaded,
I owe my husband's life.
</p>

<p>
General Fitz Lee welcomed him in hearty fashion:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter_head">
"<span class="smcap">Headquarters</span>, August 26, 1863.
</p>

<p>
"Honorable, General, or Mr? How shall I address
you? Damn it, there's no difference! Come up to see
me. Whilst I regret the causes that induced you to resign
your position, I am glad, really, that the country has not
lost your active services, and that your choice to serve her
has been cast in one of my regiments.

<p>
As a common soldier in the cavalry service, General
Pryor was assigned the duties of his position,
from not one of which did he ever excuse himself.
</p>

<p>
On May 3 General Lee had offered thanks to
Almighty God for a great victory at Chancellorsville.
</p>

<p>
On May 4, the date of Agnes's letter, news came
that General Jackson had been seriously wounded
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' name='Page_243' href='#Page_243'>243</a></span>
and his arm amputated. On May 10 the General
died, and we were all plunged into the deepest grief.
By every man, woman, and child in the Confederacy
this good man and great general was mourned
as never man was mourned before. From the
moment of his death the tide of fortune seemed to
turn. Henceforth there would be only disaster and
defeat. In losing General Jackson our dear commander
lost his right arm. But this only inspired
him to greater and more aggressive action.
</p>

<p>
He decided to take his army into Pennsylvania,
and after entering that state, on June 27, he issued
his famous order, reminding one of General Washington's
similar order from Pennsylvania, 1777:â€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center post">
"<span class="smcap">General Order No. 73. From the Headquarters,
Army of Northern Virginia</span>
</p>

<p>
"The commanding general has observed the conduct of
the troops upon the march, and confidently anticipates results
commensurate with the high spirit they have manifested....
Their conduct has, with few exceptions, been
in keeping with their character as soldiers, and entitles them
to approbation and praise.
</p>

<p>
"There have, however, been instances of forgetfulness,
on the part of some, that they have in keeping the yet unsullied
reputation of the army, and that the duties exacted
of us by civilization and Christianity are not less obligatory
in the country of the enemy than in our own.
</p>

<p>
"The commanding general considers that no greater
disgrace could befall the army, and through it our whole
people, than the perpetration of the barbarous outrages
upon the innocent and defenceless, and the wanton destruction
of private property, which have marked the course of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244' href='#Page_244'>244</a></span>
the enemy in our country. Such proceedings not only disgrace
the perpetrators and all connected with them, but are
subversive of the discipline and efficiency of the army, and
destructive of the ends of our present movements. It must
be remembered that we make war only on armed men, that
we cannot take vengeance for the wrongs our people have
suffered without lowering ourselves in the eyes of all whose
abhorrence has been excited by the atrocities of our enemy,
and offending against Him to whom vengeance belongeth,
without whose favor and support must all prove vain."
</p>

<p>
Washington, Lee, and McClellan were not alone
in their ideas of civilized and Christian warfare.
</p>

<p>
Eighty-four years before this time there was a war
in this same country. It was a rebellion, too, and a
nobleman led the troops of Great Britain through
the country to subdue the rebellion. The people
through whose land he marched were bitterly hostile.
They shot his foraging parties, sentinels, and stragglers;
they fired upon him from every wood.
</p>

<p>
On January 28, 1781, this order was issued from
camp near Beatty's Ford:â€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Lord Cornwallis has so often experienced the zeal and
good will of the army that he has not the smallest doubt
that the officers and soldiers will most cheerfully submit to
the ill conveniences that must naturally attend war, so remote
from water, carriage, and the magazines of the army.
The supply of rum for a time will be absolutely impossible,
and that of meal very uncertain. It is needless to point out
to the officers the necessity of preserving the strictest discipline,
and of preventing the oppressed people from suffering
violence by the hands from whom they are taught to look
for protection."

And so it is that every circumstance of life is
an opportunity for a noble spirit. When we "let
slip the dogs of war," some men find excuse for
license and cruelty, others for the exercise of self-restraint
and compassion. Admiral Porter tells a
story which may illustrate the strange "point of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246' href='#Page_246'>246</a></span>
view" in the minds of some brave men upon the
legitimate conduct of war.
</p>

<p>
"The exploits of the army in foraging," said the
Admiral, "afforded matter for much amusement
among the officers at Vicksburg. At Bruensburg,
General Grant made his headquarters in the spring
of 1863. Bruensburg and the surrounding country
was the great depot for live stock, grain, etc., and
the soldiers' lines seemed to have fallen in pleasant
places. <i>Foraging was not prohibited</i>; in fact the soldiers
were cautioned to save the government rations
for an emergency, so that the squealing of pigs, the
bleating of calves and sheep, and the cackling of
poultry were common sounds in camp."
</p>

<p>
As an illustration of the wholesale robbery of the
peaceful citizens Admiral Porter tells of an appeal
made to General Grant by an old man, long past
the age to bear arms, who pushed aside the flaps of
the General's tent and thrust in his head. In his
hand he held a rope to which was attached a miserable
mule, minus one eye. He told the General, in
the poor-white's vernacular, of his nice little farm,
well stocked "with the finest lot of chickens,
turkeys, pigs, an' sheep as ever you seen," and that
the Yankee soldiers had stolen everything except the
"ole muel and one goose."
</p>

<p>
"Here, Rawlins, attend to this man," said the
General, and walked away.
</p>

<p>
"What do you expect me to do?" inquired General
Rawlins. "How are you going to find out who
did all you complain of?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I <i>know</i> who did it," said the old fellow;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247' href='#Page_247'>247</a></span>
"it's one of Gin'ral A. J. Smith's rigiments. I
know the sargint what led 'em on. He belongs to
the Thirteenth Iowy, an' he kin skin a hog quicker'n
greased lightnin'!"
</p>

<p>
Just then General Smith walked in the tent, and
the complaint was laid before him.
</p>

<p>
"They weren't my men, sir," said General Smith.
"I know my boys too well. They would never
have left that mule and goose! No, sir, my boys
don't do things that way; and I advise you, old
man, to go back and keep your eye on your goose
and mule."
</p>

<p>
The old man turned to gaze on his beloved mule.
It was gone! A soldier stood at the end of the
rope!
</p>

<p>
General Smith glanced proudly around. "Ah,
Rawlins," he said, "those must have been my men
after all. If I could only hear they had eaten the
goose, I should be sure of it."
</p>

<p>
The story does not follow the aged man to his
desolate cabin; but it followed the Admiral as an
<i>amusing</i> story for many an evening around the
punch-bowl.
</p>

<p>
Among the men arrayed against the South in
battle were many worthy descendants of the men
who achieved their independence in 1775-1781,
and who then fought shoulder to shoulder with
the South.
</p>

<p>
"They were a brave, self-reliant, patriotic race,
and in all the characteristics of manliness, perseverance,
fortitude, and courage, were the equals of
any race that ever lived." It was from these men,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' name='Page_248' href='#Page_248'>248</a></span>
native-born Americans of the North and West, that
many a persecuted woman in Georgia, South Carolina,
and North Carolina received help and restitution
of property. But war brutalizes mean men.
The few cannot control the many.
</p>

<p>
War, wicked, cruel war, knows no mercy, no justice.
War is the dreadful crime of the world.
Against war prayer should ascend day and night
until it shall cease forever. It is not right that it
should be classed with "pestilence and famine" in
our prayers. It should have an hourâ€”a daily
hourâ€”to itself, when old men and women, young
men and maidens, and little children should implore
God to make wars to cease from the fair world He
has created.
</p>

<p>
The refugees who came to us from exposed districts
within the enemy's lines thrilled our souls with
horror. We heard these stories from the valley of
Virginia and from Norfolk. Liberty of speech in
child or woman was sternly punished. At Norfolk
a clergyman, the Rev. Dr. Armstrong, had been put
in the chain gang and compelled to work on the
streets because of disrespectful allusion to the presence
of Federal troops. We trembled at these
recitals; but we never dreamed the war would
come to us. At twilight, when the air was clear
and still, we could hear the booming of the heavy
guns of the ironclads on James River; but
McClellan had been unable to take Richmond, and
nobody would want little Petersburg.
</p>

<p>
In July, General Lee fought and lost the great
battle of Gettysburg, which plunged our state into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249' href='#Page_249'>249</a></span>
mourning and lamentation. Never can the world
read with dry eyes of the charge of Pickett's brigade
and the manner in which it was met. "Decry war
as we may and ought," says Rhodes in his "History,"
"'breathes there the man with soul so dead' who
would not thrill with emotion to claim for his countrymen
the men who made that charge and the men
who met it? General Lee bore the disaster magnificently.
An officer, attempting to place on other
shoulders some portion of the blame, General Lee
said solemnly, '<i>All this has been</i> <span class="smcap">MY</span> <i>fault</i>â€”it is <i>I</i>
that have lost this fight, and you must all help me
out of it in the best way you can.'"
</p>

<p>
The Federal loss in this battle, killed, wounded,
and captured, was 23,003, the Confederate 20,451â€”making
a total of 43,454 good and true men lost,
in one battle, to their country. The emblem of
mourning hung at many a door among our friends
in Richmond and Petersburg. Close upon this
disaster came news of the fall of Vicksburg.
</p>

<p>
On July 3d my General (this was before he resigned
his commission) was in Richmond serving on
a court-martial. In the evening he called upon
Mr. and Mrs. Davis, and was told the President
was not receiving, but that Mrs. Davis would be
glad to see him. The weather was intensely hot,
and my husband felt he must not inflict a long
visit; but when he rose to leave, Mrs. Davis begged
him to remain, and seemed averse from being left
alone. After a few minutes the President came in,
weary, silent, and depressed. The news from Gettysburg
sufficiently accounted for his melancholy aspect.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250' href='#Page_250'>250</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Presently a dear little boy entered in his night-robe,
and kneeling beside his father's knee repeated his
evening prayer of thankfulness, and of supplication
for God's blessing on the country. The President
laid his hand on the boy's head and fervently responded,
"Amen." The scene recurred vividly,
in the light of future events, to my husband's
memory. With the coming day came the news of
the surrender of Vicksburg,â€”news of which Mr.
Davis had been forewarned the evening before,â€”and
already the Angel of Death was hovering near,
to enfold the beautiful boy and bear him away from
a world of trouble.
</p>

<p>
I had taken my young family to a watering place in
the county of Amelia, and there a few homeless women
like myself were spending the months of July and
August. Everything was so sad there was no heart
in any one for gayety of any kind; but one evening
the proprietor proposed that the ball room be
lighted and a solitary fiddler, "Bozeman,"â€”who
was also the barber,â€”be installed in the musicians'
seat and show us what he could do. Young feet
cannot resist a good waltz or polka, and the floor
was soon filled with care-forgetting maidensâ€”there
were no men except the proprietor and the fiddler.
Presently a telegram was received by the former.
We all huddled together under the chandelier to
read it. Vicksburg had fallen! The gallant General
Pemberton had been starved into submission.
Surely and swiftly the coil was tightening around us.
Surely and swiftly should we, too, be starved into
submission.

<h2>
CHAPTER XVII
<br />
<span class="s05">A HOMELESS WANDERER</span>
</h2>

<p>
Having no longer a home of my own, it
was decided that I should go to my people
in Charlotte County. One of my sons,
Theo, and two of my little daughters were already
there, and there I expected to remain until the end
of the war.
</p>

<p>
But repeated attempts to reach my country home
resulted in failure. Marauding parties and guerillas
were flying all over the country. There had been
alarm at a bridge over the Staunton near the
Oaks, and the old men and boys had driven away
the enemy. I positively <i>could</i> not venture alone.
</p>

<p>
So it was decided that I should return to my husband's
old district, to Petersburg, and there find
board in some private family.
</p>

<p>
I reached Petersburg in the autumn and wandered
about for days seeking refuge in some household.
Many of my old friends had left town. Strangers
and refugees had rented the houses of some of these,
while others were filled with the homeless among
their own kindred. There was no room anywhere for
me, and my small purse was growing so slender that
I became anxious. Finally my brother-in-law offered
me an overseer's house on one of his "quarters."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' name='Page_252' href='#Page_252'>252</a></span>
The small dwelling he placed at my disposal was to
be considered temporary only; some one of his town
houses would soon be vacant. When I drove out
to the little house, I found it hardly better than
a hovel. We entered a rude, unplastered kitchen,
the planks of the floor loose and wide apart, the
earth beneath plainly visible. There were no windows
in this smoke-blackened kitchen. A door
opened into a tiny room with a fireplace, window, and
out-door of its own; and a short flight of stairs led
to an unplastered attic, so that the little apartment
was entered by two doors and a staircase. It was
already cold, but we had to beat a hasty retreat and
sit outside while a colored boy made a "smudge" in
the house, to dislodge the wasps that had tenanted
it for many months. My brother had lent me bedding
for the overseer's pine bedstead and the low
trundle-bed underneath. The latter, when drawn
out at night, left no room for us to stand. When
that was done, we had to go to bed. For furniture
we had only two or three wooden chairs and a small
table. There were no curtains, neither carpet nor
rugs, no china. There was wood at the woodpile,
and a little store of meal and rice, with a small bit of
bacon in the overseer's grimy closet. This was to
be my winter home.
</p>

<p>
Petersburg was already virtually in a state of siege.
Not a tithe of the food needed for its army of refugees
could be brought to the city. Our highway, the
river, was filled, except for a short distance, with
Federal gunboats. The markets had long been
closed. The stores of provisions had been exhausted,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253' href='#Page_253'>253</a></span>
so that a grocery could offer little except a
barrel or two of molasses made from the domestic
sorghum sugar-caneâ€”an acrid and unwholesome
sweet used instead of sugar for drink with water or
milk, and for eating with bread. The little boys at
once began to keep house. They valiantly attacked
the woodpile, and found favor in the eyes of Mary
and the man, whom I never knew as other than
"Mary's husband." He and Mary were left in
charge of the quarter and had a cabin near us.
</p>

<p>
I had no books, no newspapers, no means of communicating
with the outside world; but I had one
neighbor, Mrs. Laighton, a daughter of Winston
Henry, granddaughter of Patrick Henry. She lived
near me with her husbandâ€”a Northern man. Both
were very cultivated, very poor, very kind. Mrs.
Laighton, as Lucy Henry,â€”a brilliant young girl,â€”had
been one of the habitues of the Oaks.
We had much in common, and her kind heart went
out in love and pity for me.
</p>

<p>
She taught me many expedients: that to float
tea on the top of a cup of hot water would make
it "go farther" than when steeped in the usual way;
also that the herb, "life everlasting," which grew in
the fields would make excellent yeast, having somewhat
the property of hops; and that the best substitute
for coffee was not the dried cubes of sweet
potato, but parched corn or parched meal, making a
nourishing drink, not unlike the "postum" of to-day.
And Mrs. Laighton kept me a "living soul" in
other and higher ways. She reckoned intellectual
ability the greatest of God's gifts, raising us so far
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254' href='#Page_254'>254</a></span>
above the petty need of material things that we could
live in spite of their loss. Her talk was a tonic to
me. It stimulated me to play my part with courage,
seeing I had been deemed worthy, by the God who
made me, to suffer in this sublime struggle for liberty.
She was as truly gifted as was ever her illustrious
grandfather. To hear her was to believe, so
persuasive and convincing was her eloquence.
</p>

<p>
I had not my good Eliza Page this winter. She
had fallen ill. I had a stout little black girl, Julia,
as my only servant; but Mary had a friend, a
"corn-field hand," "Anarchy," who managed to
help me at odd hours. Mrs. Laighton sent me
every morning a print of butter as large as a silver
dollar, with two or three perfect biscuits, and sometimes
a bowl of persimmons or stewed dried peaches.
She had a cow, and churned every day, making her
biscuits of the buttermilk, which was much too precious
to drink.
</p>

<p>
A great snow-storm overtook us a day or two
before Christmas. My little boys kindled a roaring
fire in the cold, open kitchen, roasted chestnuts,
and set traps for the rabbits and "snowbirds"
which never entered them. They made no murmur
at the bare Christmas; they were loyal little
fellows to their mother. My day had been spent
in mending their garments,â€”making them was a
privilege denied me, for I had no materials. I was
not "all unhappy!" The rosy cheeks at my fireside
consoled me for my privations, and something
within me proudly rebelled against weakness or
complaining.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255' href='#Page_255'>255</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The flakes were falling thickly at midnight, when
I suddenly became very ill. I sent out for Mary's
husband and bade him gallop in to Petersburg,
three miles distant, and fetch me Dr. Withers. I
was dreadfully ill when he arrivedâ€”and as he
stood at the foot of my bed I said to him: "It
doesn't matter much for me, Doctor! But my
husband will be grateful if you keep me alive."
</p>

<p>
When I awoke from a long sleep, he was still standing
at the foot of my bed where I had left himâ€”it
seemed to me ages ago! I put out my hand and it
touched a little warm bundle beside me. God had
given me a dear child!
</p>

<p>
The doctor spoke to me gravely and most
kindly. "I must leave you now," he said, "and,
alas! I cannot come again. There are so many, so
many sick. Call all your courage to your aid.
Remember the pioneer women, and all they were
able to survive. This woman," indicating Anarchy,
"is a field-hand, but she is a mother, and she has
agreed to help you during the Christmas holidaysâ€”her
own time. And now, God bless you, and good-by!"
</p>

<p>
I soon slept againâ€”and when I awoke the very
Angel of Strength and Peace had descended and
abode with me. I resolved to prove to myself that
if I was called to be a great woman, I <i>could</i> be a
great woman. Looking at me from my bedside
were my two little boys. They had been taken the
night before across the snow-laden fields to my
brother's house, but had risen at daybreak and had
"come home to take care" of me!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' name='Page_256' href='#Page_256'>256</a></span>
</p>

<p>
My little maid Julia left me Christmas morning.
She said it was too lonesome, and her "mistis"
always let her choose her own places. I engaged
"Anarchy" at twenty-five dollars a week for all her
nights. But her hands, knotted by work in the
fields, were too rough to touch my babe. I was
propped upon pillows and dressed her myself, sometimes
fainting when the exertion was over.
</p>

<p>
I was still in my bed three weeks afterward, when
one of my boys ran in, exclaiming in a frightened
voice, "Oh, mamma, an old gray soldier is coming
in!"
</p>

<p>
He stoodâ€”this old gray soldierâ€”and looked
at me, leaning on his sabre.
</p>

<p>
"Is this the reward my country gives me?" he
said; and not until he spoke did I recognize my
husband. Turning on his heel, he went out, and I
heard him call:â€”
</p>

<p>
"John! John! Take those horses into town

them for anything! Get a cart and bring butter,
eggs, and everything you can find for Mrs. Pryor's
comfort."

He had been with Fitz Lee on that dreadful tramp
through the snow after Averill. He had suffered
cold and hunger, had slept on the ground without
shelter, sharing his blanket with John. He had
used his own horses, and now if the government
needed him the government might mount him.
He had no furlough, and soon reported for duty;
but not before he had moved us, early in January,
into townâ€”one of my brother-in-law's houses having
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257' href='#Page_257'>257</a></span>
been vacated at the beginning of the year. John
knew his master too well to construe him literally,
and had reserved the fine gray, Jubal Early, for his
use. That I might not again fall into the sad
plight in which he had found me, he purchased
three hundred dollars in gold, and instructed me to
prepare a girdle to be worn all the time around my
waist, concealed by my gown. The coins were
quilted in; each had a separate section to itself, so
that with scissors I might extract one at a time without
disturbing the rest.
</p>

<p>
From the beginning of the war to its last year Petersburg
had remained in a state of comparative repose,
broken only by the arrival and departure of the troops
passing from the South to the Army of Northern
Virginia. These, as we have said, were always welcomed,
if they passed through by day, with gifts of
flowers, fruit, and more substantial refreshment.
</p>

<p>
To continue this greeting, Petersburg women
denied themselves every luxury. The tramp of
soldiers was a familiar sound in our streets, but no
hostile footsteps had ever resounded there, no hostile
gun had yet been fired within its limits. It is true
the low muttering of distant artillery as it came up
the James and the Appomattox from the field of
Big Bethel had caught the ears of the citizens, and
they had listened with heightened interest in its
louder booming as it told of Seven Pines, and the
seven days' struggle around Richmond, just twenty
miles away. But when the baffled army of McClellan
retired in the direction of Washington, and
General Lee moved away beyond the Potomac, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258' href='#Page_258'>258</a></span>
old men, women, and children (for there were no
men left capable of bearing arms) settled down to
their daily avocationsâ€”and daily prayers for the
dear boys at the front.
</p>

<p>
Families that had fled from Petersburg at the time
of McClellan's advance upon Richmond had now returned.
My next-door neighbors were Mr. Thomas
Branch and the Rev. Churchill Gibson. From one
of my windows I could look into a large garden,
where the workmen were busy planting seeds
and setting long rows of onions, cabbage plants,
tomato plants, and sticks for the green peas just
peeping out of the brown earth. Across the street
lived the widow of the Hon. Richard Kidder
Meade, with her accomplished daughters, Mary,
Marion, and Julia. These were delightful neighbors.
Lower down lived the Bollings,â€”parents of Tabb
Bolling, the superb, already affianced to General
Rooney Lee. Then Mr. and Mrs. William Banister,
with another houseful of lovely young women,
"Mollie" and "Gussie" Banister; and their cousin,
Alice Gregory, waiting until the cruel war should be
over to reward handsome Colonel Arthur Herbert.
Alice's own home was just outside our fortifications,
and was, I believe, burned when Petersburg was
assaulted. Beautiful Patty Hardee was another of
these girls. Helen made the ninth of the band of
Muses. All were accomplished in music. Marion's
latest fancy was significant,â€”Gottschalk's "Last
Hope!" Sweet Alice took our hearts with her
touching hymns, giving a new meaning to the
simplest words.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259' href='#Page_259'>259</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Gussie Banister, the youngest of all, sang "Lorena"
and "Juanita"; and Mattie Paul, who often
came over from Richmond, infused an intenser tone
of sadness with Beethoven's andantes and Chopin's
"Funeral March." None of the gayety of Richmond,
of which we read in our letters, was apparent
in Petersburg. Too many of her sons had been
slain or were in present peril.
</p>

<p>
"What friends you girls are!" I said, when I met
them, walking together, like a boarding school.
</p>

<p>
"We are all going to be old maids together,"
said one, "and so we are getting acquainted with
each other."
</p>

<p>
"Speak for yourself, John," said Helen, who had
become the fortunate possessor of "The Courtship
of Miles Standish" and was lending "Longfellow's
Last" around to the rest. "I spoke for <i>my</i>self, you
remember," she added, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Well! it will be no disgrace to be an old maid,"
said another. "We can always swear our going-to-be-husband
was killed in the war." And then a
wistful look passed over the young faces as each one
remembered some absent lover.
</p>

<p>
The camp-fire of my own family brigade was now
lighted in the kitchen, where the hero, John, who
had been left to take care of me, popped corn for
my little boys and held them with stories of Fitz
Lee's pursuit of Averill.
</p>

<p>
"Tell us, John," implored his audience, "tell us
every bit of it. Begin at Winchester."
</p>

<p>
"No," said John. "You'll tell your ma, and
then she won't sleep a wink to-night."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260' href='#Page_260'>260</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"She doesn't sleep anyway, John! When we
wake up, she's always sitting by the window, looking
out at the stars."
</p>

<p>
"Co'se, if that's the case, here goes. Gen'al Lee had
five thousand troopers, an' they marched from Winchester
to Salem. We hadn't a tent, an' no rations
wuth talkin' about, an' it rained an' hailed an' sleeted
most every step o' the way. Your pa never took
off his boots for two solid weeks, an' they were full
of water all the time, an' the icicles hung from his
long hair. We drew up in line at the White Sulphur
Springs an' <i>dar'd</i> Averill to fight usâ€”but he
slunk away in the night. I cert'inly was sorry for
Marse Roger at the White Sulphur. He went up
into the po'ch of one of the little cottages an' sat
down thinkin' an' thinkin'. 'Are you sick, Marse
Roger?' I asked him. 'No, John,' he said, 'only
a little homesick, to think of the happy times we
used to spend hereâ€”and our fathers and mothers
before us!' 'But we done drive 'im away!' I say
to him, an' he got up and said, 'Do you think so,
John?' Anyway, Averill didn't git a chance to
sleep in one of them cottages, nor yet to burn it!
Ther' was a hospital thar' then."
</p>

<p>
"Where did <i>you</i> sleep?" the boys asked.
</p>

<p>
"Who, me? I slep' every night o' my life under
the same blanket with your pa, I did. I don' care
how tired he was, he never slep' so sound he couldn't
hear the snorin'. 'Git up, John,' he would say,
'tell that man snorin' that he's burnin'.'" John
laughed at the reminiscence. "I've scared many a
good soldier that way, an' made him turn overâ€”when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_261' name='Page_261' href='#Page_261'>261</a></span>
the fightin' an' shootin' couldn't move
him."
</p>

<p>
"But you <i>did</i> retreat after all, didn't you, John?"
</p>

<p>
"Retreat! Retreat nothin'! Gen'al Lee got so
he didn' care to ketch that scalawag Yankee. He
warn' wuth ketchin'. We got pris'ners enough now
an' to spar. Gen'al Lee come home cos he didn'
have no use for Averill. He drove him away,
though. He sholy did!"
</p>

<p>
John was installed as cook and commissary-general.
He had no material except flour, rice, peas,
and dried apples, such grease or "shortening" as
he could extract from bones he purchased of the
quartermaster, and sorghum molasses. He made
yeast of "life everlasting" I brought from the
country,â€”and he gave us waffles and pancakes.
John's pancakes, compared with the ordinary article,
were as the fleecy cloud to the dull, heavy clod beneath.
Butter could be had at eight dollars a pound;
meat was four and five dollars a poundâ€”prices we
learned very soon afterward to regard as extremely
cheap; bargains, indeed, of the first water. From
Agnes's letters I have reason to suppose that Petersburg
suffered more from scarcity than did Richmond.
There, dinners were given by the members
of the Cabinet, and wine was served as of old. In
Petersburg we had already entered upon our long
season of want. The town was drained by its
generous gifts to the army; regiments were constantly
passing, and none ever departed without the
offer of refreshment.
</p>

<p>
We heard no complaints from our soldier boys,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_262' name='Page_262' href='#Page_262'>262</a></span>
still in their winter quarters. But a letter to the
army from General Lee filled our hearts with anxiety.

On January the 30th Agnes wrote from Richmond:â€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"How can you be even dreaming of new cups and
saucers? Mend your old ones, my dear, with white lead.
That is what we are doing here; and when the cup is
very much broken, the triangular, rectangular, and other
'angular' lines of white give it quite a Japanesque effect.
There is not a bit of china for sale in the capital of the
Confederacy. A forlorn little chipped setâ€”twelve odd
piecesâ€”sold last week at auction for $200â€”and as
to hats and bonnets! We are washing the old ones and
plaiting straw for the new. I'll send you a package of straw
I gleaned and dyed for you last summer. Did I tell you
about that straw? I asked my host at the farmhouse to
give me a few sheaves, but he shook his head and opined
it would be 'sinful in these hard times to take good vittles
and convert it into hats.' I could not see clearly that straw
came under the generic term 'vittles'â€”unless indeed the
straw fed the animal that fed the soldier. However, I
meekly borrowed a sunbonnet and gleaned my straw.
Half of it I popped into the kettle of boiling black dye
behind the kitchen,â€”when the lady of the manor was
looking another way,â€”and we will mix the black and
white for the boys' hats. But mark the quick and sure
grinding of the mills of the gods. After the wheat was
all stacked there came a mighty rain with fog and warm
mist. One day my host brought in what seemed to be a
feathery bouquet of delicate green. It was a bunch of
wheat, every grain of which had sprouted. He had lost
his crop!

Champagne is $350 a dozen, but we sometimes have
champagne! The confectioners charge $15 for a cake,
but we have cake. My flounced gray silk is behaving
admirably, but I am afraid my Washington friends remember
it as an old acquaintance. I never go out without
meeting them. I have seen Dr. Garnett and Judge Scarborough
and Mr. Dimitri on the street, and often meet
Mr. Hunter, running about, in his enthusiasm, like a boy.
But what do you think? I never could bear that Lord
Lyons, with his red face and small eyes like ferrets'; and
now we have reason to suppose that England would have
recognized us but for his animosity against us. He says
'the Confederacy is on its last legs.' We have heard from
dear old Dudley Mann; but of course <i>he</i> can do nothing

My Petersburg beauties were all wearing hats of
their own manufacture, the favorite style being the
Alpine with a pointed crown. For trimming, very
soft and lovely flowers were made of feathers, the
delicate white feather with a tuft of fleecy marabout
at its stem. The marabout tuft would be carefully
drawn off, to be made into swan's-down trimming.
A wire was prepared and covered with green paper
for a stem, a little ball of wax fastened on the end,
and covered with a tiny tuft of the down for a
centre, and around this the feathers were stuckâ€”with
incurving petals for apple blossoms and half-open
roses,â€”and reversed for camellias. Neatly
trimmed and suitably tinted, these flowers were handsome
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' name='Page_265' href='#Page_265'>265</a></span>
enough for anybody, and were in great demand.
Cocks' plumes were also used on hats, iridescent,
and needing no coloring. With the downy breast
of a goose which came into my possession I essayed
the making of a powder-puff for my baby, but alas!
the oil in the cuticle proved a perennial spring which
could not be dried up by soda or sunning, and finally
I saw my powder-puff disappearing in a hole, drawn
downward by a vigorous and hungry rat.
</p>

<p>
The young girls who visited me never complained
of their privations in the matter of food, but they
sorely grieved over their shabby wardrobes.
</p>

<p>
"I really think," said one, "if we can only get
along until we can wear white waists, we shall do very
well. Every time a white waist is washed it's made
newâ€”but these old flannel sacksâ€”ugh!"
</p>

<p>
One day Mary Meade made me a visit. Always
beautiful, her face wore on this afternoon a seraphic,
beatific expression.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, dear," I said, "all about it." I supposed
she had heard her lover had been promoted
or was coming home on a furlough.
</p>

<p>
She held up her two hands. "<i>It's just these
gloves!</i>" said Mary. "I can't help it. They
make me perfectly happy! They have just come
through the blockade."
</p>

<p>
The butcher shops were closed, and many of the
dry-goods stores; but somebody had ordered a large
quantity of narrow crimson woollen braid, and had
failed to accept it. We seized upon it. Every one
of us had garments embroidered with itâ€”in scrolls,
Maltese crosses, undulating lines, leaves; all of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' name='Page_266' href='#Page_266'>266</a></span>
which goes to prove that the desire for ornament
is an instinct of our nature, outliving the grosser
affections for the good things of the table. The
consciousness of being well dressed, we have been
told, will afford a peace of mind far exceeding anything
to be derived from the comforts of religion.
</p>

<p>
It had not been many years since every Virginia
farm owned a house for a great cumbrous loom,
with beams supported against the ceiling. The
door of the loom-house was again opened, and the
weaver installed upon her high bench. Cotton
cloth was woven and dyed yellow with butternut,
black with walnut-bark, gray with willow. A mordant
to "set the dye" was unattainableâ€”but at
last rusty iron, nails, old horseshoes, old clamps
and hinges, were found to be effective. Every atom
of black silk was a treasure. It was shredded to
mix with the cotton before carding. Even now the
cells of my brain waken at the sight of a bundle of
old black silk, and my fingers would fain respond.
</p>

<p>
Pins became scarce. People walked about with
downcast eyes; they were looking for pins! Thorns
were gathered and dried to use as pins. Dentists'
gold soon disappeared. The generation succeeding
the war period had not good teeth. AnÃ¦stheticsâ€”morphine,
chloroform, opiumâ€”were contraband of
war. This was our great grief. Our soldier boys,
who had done nothing to bring the war upon the
country, must suffer every pang that followed the
disasters of battle. The United States gave artificial
limbs to its maimed soldiers. Ours had only
their crutches, and these of rude home manufacture.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_267' name='Page_267' href='#Page_267'>267</a></span>
The blockade-running, for which our women were
so much blamed, was often undertaken to bring
morphine and medicine to our hospitals. The
fashions of the day included a small round cushion
worn at the back of a lady's belt, to lift the heavy
hoop and many petticoats then in vogue. It was
called "a bishop," and was made of silk. These
were brought home from "a visit to friends at the
North" filled with quinine and morphine. They
were examined at the frontier by a long pin stuck
through them. If the pin met no resistance, they
were allowed to pass.
</p>

<p>
The famine moved on apace, but its twin sister,
fever, never visited us. Never had Petersburg been
so healthy. No garbage was decaying in the streets.
Every particle of animal or vegetable food was consumed,
and the streets were clean. Flocks of pigeons
would follow the children who were eating
bread or crackers. Finally the pigeons vanished
having been themselves eaten. Rats and mice disappeared.
The poor cats staggered about the streets,
and began to die of hunger. At times meal was the
only article attainable except by the rich. An ounce
of meat daily was considered an abundant ration for
each member of the family. To keep food of any
kind was impossibleâ€”cows, pigs, bacon, flour, everything,
was stolen, and even sitting hens were taken
from the nest.
</p>

<p>
In the presence of such facts as these General Lee
was able to report that nearly every regiment in his
army had reÃ«nlistedâ€”and for the war! And very
soon he also reported that the army was out of meat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' name='Page_268' href='#Page_268'>268</a></span>
and had but one day's rations of bread. One of our
papers copied the following from the <i>Mobile Advertiser</i>:â€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"In General Lee's tent meat is eaten but twice a week,
the General not allowing it oftener, because he believes indulgence
in meat to be criminal in the present straitened
condition of the country. His ordinary dinner consists of
a head of cabbage boiled in salt water, and a pone of corn
bread. Having invited a number of gentlemen to dine with
him, General Lee, in a fit of extravagance, ordered a sumptuous
repast of bacon and cabbage. The dinner was served,
and behold, a great pile of cabbage and a bit of bacon, or
'middling,' about four inches long and two inches across.
The guests, with commendable politeness, unanimously declined
the bacon, and it remained in the dish untouched.
Next day General Lee, remembering the delicate titbit
which had been so providentially preserved, ordered his
servant to bring that 'middling.' The man hesitated,
scratched his head, and finally owned up:â€”
</p>

<p>
"'Marse Robertâ€”de fac' isâ€”dat ar middlin' was
borrowed middlin'. We-all didn' have no middlin'. I
done paid it back to de place whar I got it fum.'
</p>

<p>
"General Lee heaved a sigh of deepest disappointment,
and pitched into the cabbage."
</p>
</div> <!-- /blockquot -->

<p>
No man had ever lived in more comfort, nor
was more surrounded by the accessories and appointments
of luxury and refinement. His aide, Colonel
Walter Taylor, has written me:â€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"During the time that General Lee was in service he
manifested that complete self-abnegation and dislike of
parade and ceremony which became characteristic of him.
Accompanied originally by a staff of but two persons, and,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_269' name='Page_269' href='#Page_269'>269</a></span>
after the death of Colonel Washington, with but one aide-de-camp,
with no escort or body-guard, no couriers or
guides, he made the campaign under altogether unostentatious
and really uncomfortable circumstances. One solitary
tent constituted his headquarters camp; this served for the
General and his aide; and when visitors were entertained,
as actually occurred, the General shared his blanket with his
aide, turning over those of the latter to his guest. His dinner
service was of tin,â€”tin plates, tin cups, tin bowls,
everything of tin,â€”and consequently indestructible; and
to the annoyance and disgust of the subordinates who
sighed for porcelain could not or would not be lost; indeed,
with the help of occasional additions, this tin furniture
continued to do service for several campaigns; and it was
only in the last year of the war, while the army was around
Petersburg, that a set of china was surreptitiously introduced
into the baggage of the headquarters of the army. This
displaced for a time the chaste and elaborate <i>plate</i>; but on
resuming 'light marching order' at the time of the evacuation
of Richmond and Petersburg, the china, which had
been borrowed by the staff, was returned; the tins were
again produced, and did good service until the surrender of
the army, when they passed into the hands of individuals
who now preserve them as mementos of the greatest commander
in the great war."</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br />
<span class="s05">THE SIEGE OF PETERSBURG</span>
</h2>

<p>
June 9 will always be a sacred day to the
citizens of Petersburg. Every man capable
of bearing arms had enlisted early in the service
of the Southern Confederacy. They felt that
much was expected of them. Petersburg had behaved
gallantly in 1776, and had been the "Cockade
City" in 1812. For the first three years of the war,
as we have seen, no gun was fired near her gates.
Only old men, women, and children were left in the
town. The maidens bore their denied lives with
cheerfulness, sustained and encouraged by the steadfast
and serene bearing of their elders. Everybody
worked for the soldiers and assembled every afternoon
to pray for them. The city was almost as
quiet as Blandford, her sister city of the dead, where
the old Blands, Bollings, and Poythresses slept in
perfect peace.
</p>

<p>
True, Petersburg, like Richmond, had her day of
feverish excitement, known in Confederate history
as "<i>Pawnee</i> Sunday," when both cities had been
menaced by an ironclad. Early in the morning a
telegraph operator had relieved a dull hour by interviewing
his colleague at City Point, "Any danger
from the <i>Pawnee</i>?" receiving as answer, "The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_271' name='Page_271' href='#Page_271'>271</a></span>
<i>Pawnee</i> is coming up the Appomattox." The town
was wild. Everything valuable was hidden away,
and the militia was drawn up, the lads of twelve and
fourteen loading their hunting pieces and rallying
to the town hall. Time having been allowed for
any reasonable, well-conducted man-of-war to steam
twelve miles, the telegraph operator, sorely pressed
by questions, again interrogated his City Point friend.
"What's become of the <i>Pawnee</i>? She isn't here
yet." The irate answer spun over the line: "Youâ€”fool!
I said the <i>Pawnee</i> is <i>not</i> coming up the
river." Everything fell flat at once. There was an
avowed sense of disappointment at the loss of an
opportunity which might not come again. The dear
womenâ€”the best I have ever known in any landâ€”resumed
their gentle ministrations, working much
for the hospitals, and supplementing with culinary
skill many deficiencies in material. But the men
chafed. The veterans had felt the blood leap in
their veins with the fire of youth; the boys longed
for the fray; the physician, tied to his humdrum
routine, yearned for the larger sphere in the field.
"The dearest sacrifice a man can make to his country
is his ambition."
</p>

<p>
The <i>Pawnee</i> incident was a fortunate one for the
city, for it awakened the authorities to the necessity
of preparing against surprise. The old, exempt
citizens were formed into companies for home defence,
and a breastwork was prepared commanding
a road, "particularly interesting," says one of the
survivors, "because it opened to deserving Petersburgers
the beatific vision of Sussex hams and Southampton
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' name='Page_272' href='#Page_272'>272</a></span>
whiskey;" for at that moment the dreaded
foe was the wolf already at the door, rather than the
possible thunderbolt.
</p>

<p>
When General Butler, in June, 1864, commenced
his advance against Richmond, which was intended
as a coÃ¶perative movement with General Grant to
accomplish what was done the following spring, he
sent General Kautz on June 9 to make a cavalry
attack on Petersburg, twenty miles below Richmond.
The city, as I have said, was almost defenceless.
There had been much strategy,â€”marching and
countermarching,â€”too long a story to tell here;
but one thing at least was accomplished, as one of
the Confederate colonels pithily remarked, "Whatever
blunders were made, the citizens and militia
had been trotted out in the direction of the enemy
at least." Kautz's superb cavalry appeared suddenly,
was met by the old men and boys of Petersburg, and
was repulsed. Colonel Fletcher Archer commanded
the militiamen. Forewarned only a few minutes before
the charge, he hastily formed his men into line.
He says: "And what a line! In number scarcely
more than sufficient to constitute a single company,
in dress nothing to distinguish them from citizens
pursuing the ordinary avocations of life, in age many
of them silvered over with the frosts of advancing
years, while others could scarcely boast of the down
upon the cheek of youth; in arms and accoutrements
such as an impoverished government could
afford them. But there was that in their situation
which lifted them above the ordinary rules of criticism.
They stood there, not as mercenaries who,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_273' name='Page_273' href='#Page_273'>273</a></span>
having enlisted on account of profit, required the
strong arm of military law to keep them to their
post, nor as devotees of ambition craving a place in
the delusive pages of history, but they stood as a
band of patriots whose homes were imperilled and
whose loved ones were in danger of falling into the
hands of an untried foe. As they stood in line before
me I could see them glancing back at their own
dwellings under the sun of a lovely June morning.
When I addressed them in a few words of encouragement,
they listened with gravity and a full appreciation
of their situation. There was no excitement,
no shout, only calm resolution."
</p>

<p>
Thus their commander. What did the men themselves
feel? One of them wrote: "We had not long
to wait. A cloud of dust in our front told of the
hurried advance of cavalry, and the next moment
the glitter of spur and scabbard revealed a long line
of horsemen half a mile in front of us. Oh, how
we missed our cannon! Our venerable muskets
were not worth a tinker's imprecation at longer
range than a hundred yards, and we were compelled
perforce to watch the preparations for our slaughter,
much after the fashion that a rational turtle may be
presumed to contemplate the preliminaries of an
aldermanic dinner."
</p>

<p>
These were the men who saved the city. It was
in honor of them that the women and children
marched through dust and heat on June 9, 1866,
to lay garlands of flowers upon their humble graves,
and by their pious action to inaugurate the beautiful
custom, which is now observed all over the country,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' name='Page_274' href='#Page_274'>274</a></span>
of honoring the dead who fell in the Civil War. No
lovelier day ever dawned than June 9, 1864. The
magnolia grandiflora was in full flower, bee-haunted
honey-locusts perfumed the warm air, almost extinguishing
the peachy odor of the microphylla roses,
graceful garlands of jessamine hung over the trellised
front porches. Almost the first intimation
that the town received of its great peril was the
impetuous dash through the streets of the Confederate
artillery. The morning was so sweet and bright
that the women and little children were abroad in
the streets, on their way to market, or on errands
to the shops, or to visit with fruit and flowers the
old and sick among their friends. Lossie Hill, the
daintiest of dainty maidens, was picking her leisurely
way in the dusty street, going to spend the morning
with old Mrs. Mertens, when she heard the frantic
shout: "Get out of the way! Damn the women!
Run over them if they won't get out of the way."
This was the morning greeting of the politest of
gentlemen,â€”Captain Graham,â€”whose guns were
thundering down the street to the rescue of the
slender line at the front. As fast as the dread news
reached the men exempt from duty, who were engaged
in their various professions and vocations,
every one dropped his business and rushed to the
firing line. The oldest men were as ardent as the
youngest. One man, a druggist, began, while pulling
on his accoutrements, to give directions to a
venerable clerk whom he expected to dispense drugs
in his absence. "Now," said the old man, "if you
want anything done at home you must talk to somebody
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_275' name='Page_275' href='#Page_275'>275</a></span>
else! I am going to the front! I'm just like
General Lee. I should be glad if these fellows would
go back to their homes and let us alone, but if they
won't they must be made to, that's all." With their
arms around their father, pretty Molly and Gussie
Banister implored him not to go forth. He was
president of the bank, he was frail and not young.
"The duty of every man lies yonder," said he,
pointing to the puffs of smoke at the gates of the
town, and shouldering his musket he marched away.
</p>

<p>
Mr. William C. Banister was a cultivated, Christian
gentleman, one of Petersburg's most esteemed
and beloved citizens. His widow and sweet daughters
received himâ€”deadâ€”on the evening of the
battle. Molly Banister, one of the dear girls who
blessed my life in those anxious days, has told the
story of her martyred father's patriotic fervor:â€”
</p>

<p>
"My father had been on duty out on the lines
on previous occasions, always against the entreaty
of the members of his family. We thought his
infirmity, deafness, ought to excuse him. Besides
this, he was a bank officer and over military age.
When the court-house bell, on the morning of the
9th of June, sounded the alarm, he was at his place
of business, in the old Exchange Bank, and we
hoped he would not hear it. He got information,
however, of the condition of things, came at once
home, and informed us of his purpose to go out to
the lines. My mother and I besought him not to
go, urging that he could not hear the orders.
</p>

<p>
"'If I can't hear,' he said, 'I can fightâ€”I can fire
a gun. This is no time for any one to stand back.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_276' name='Page_276' href='#Page_276'>276</a></span>
Every man that can shoulder a musket must fight.
The enemy are now right upon us.'
</p>

<p>
"Bidding us good-by he left the house. On
the street, near our gate, was a man, just from the
lines. Addressing him, my father said, pointing to
the lines:â€”
</p>

<p>
"'My friend, you are needed in this direction.'
</p>

<p>
"'I am absent on leave,' said the man.
</p>

<p>
"'No leave,' replied my father, 'should keep
you on such an occasion as this. Every man
should fight now!'
</p>

<p>
"I have been informed that as he came up from
the bank he urged in the same way all whom he
met, capable, as he thought, of bearing arms."
</p>

<p>
Patty Hardee's father, another man past age for
military service, was one of the first to report for
duty, and among the first to be borne, dead, to his
daughter.
</p>

<p>
Robert Martin, also exempt, and the father of
an adoring family, immediately joined the ranks.
Almost totally deaf, he could hear no orders, and
continued to load his gun after the order to cease
firing was given and the company had begun to move
off. A comrade ran up, put his lips to his ear, and
remonstrated. "Stop firing!" exclaimed the veteran
with disgust. "Orders? I haven't heard any
orders to stop firing," and he continued to advance.
As Nelson at Copenhagen, who, when told that he
had been signalled to stop fighting, turned his blind
eye to the station, exclaiming, "<i>I</i> see no signal!"
</p>

<p>
These are but a few of the many incidents which
illustrate the courage of these stout-hearted veterans
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_277' name='Page_277' href='#Page_277'>277</a></span>
and the spirit behind their small force which inspired
that courage and compelled success. They
foughtâ€”one hundred and twenty-five men, badly
armed and untrainedâ€”behind their frail defence;
one hundred and twenty-five against twenty-three
hundred of the enemy, holding them at bay for two
hours! General Butler was greatly chagrined at
the failure of this move upon Petersburg. He sent
a characteristic letter of reproof to his general officer
north of the Appomattox. After detailing all the
mistakes that had led to the humiliating repulse, he
adds testily: "You have endeavored to state in
your report what my orders to General Kautz
were. That was no part of your report. I know
what my orders were without any information from
that source," adding, "certain it is that forty-five
hundred of my best troops have been kept at bay
by some fifteen hundred men, six hundred only of
which were Confederate troops and the rest old
men and boys, the cradle and the grave being
robbed of about equal proportions to compose the
force opposed to you."
</p>

<p>
"The cradle and the grave!" Alas, yes!
There was no triumph on the evening of that day.
Half the gallant company was gone. There was
wailing within the city gates that night. "The
hand of the reaper" had taken "the ears that were
hoary," and the daughters wept for the good, gray
head gone forward to the "eternal camping ground"
after a long life of peace. For these gallant gentlemen
the white rose which shaded my door yielded
all its pure blossoms. Well was it for the sake of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' name='Page_278' href='#Page_278'>278</a></span>
my own devotion that this was an ever blooming
rose! I had watered and nourished it with care,
unconscious of its high vocation, to bud and blossom
and lie on the noble heart of more than one
soldier. My own husband was in the fight, and
sent the first news of the repulse of the enemy and
the safety of his boyhood's home.
</p>

<p>
Immediately after the battle on the line, June 9,
we observed unusual activity in our streets. Great
army wagons passed continually, pausing often
at a well before my door to water their horses.
Clouds of dust filled the city. Evidently something
unusual was going on. "We are only re-enforcing
our defences," we said, and comforted
ourselves in the thought.
</p>

<p>
One day my father came in unexpectedly. The
army corps to which he was attached had camped
near Petersburg!
</p>

<p>
"I've just met General Lee in the street," he
said.
</p>

<p>
I uttered an exclamation of alarm. "Oh, <i>is</i> he
going to fight here?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear," said my father, sternly, "you surprise
me! The safest place for you is in the rear of
General Lee's army, and that happens to be just
where you are! The lines are established just here,
and filled with Lee's veterans."
</p>

<p>
This was startling news, but more was to follow.
One Sunday afternoon,â€”the next, I think,â€”the
Presbyterian minister had gathered his flock of
women and children for service in the church opposite
my home, and had just uttered the first sentence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_279' name='Page_279' href='#Page_279'>279</a></span>
of his opening prayer, "Almighty Father, we
are assembled to worship Thee in the presence of
our enemies," when an awful, serpentlike hiss filled
the church, and a shell burst through the wall.
</p>

<p>
In a moment the church was empty, and Dr.
Miller, the pastor, was telling me that his congregation
had dismissed itself without a benediction!
</p>

<p>
"And the shell?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"It lies upon the table in the church," said the
doctor; "nobody dares remove it."
</p>

<p>
This was the first shell that entered our part of
the town. From that moment we were shelled at
intervals, and very severely. There were no soldiers
in the city. Women were killed on the lower
streets, and an exodus from the shelled districts
commenced at once.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the enemy brought up their siege guns
of heavy artillery, they opened on the city with shell
without the slightest notice, or without giving opportunity
for the removal of non-combatants, the
sick, the wounded, or the women and children.
The fire was at first directed toward the Old Market,
presumably because of the railroad depot situated
there, about which soldiers might be supposed
to collect. But the guns soon enlarged their operations,
sweeping all the streets in the business part
of the city, and then invading the residential region.
The steeples of the churches seemed to afford targets
for their fire, all of them coming in finally for a
share of the compliment.
</p>

<p>
To persons unfamiliar with the infernal noise
made by the screaming, ricocheting, and bursting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_280' name='Page_280' href='#Page_280'>280</a></span>
of shells, it is impossible to describe the terror and
demoralization which ensued. Some families who
could not leave the besieged city dug holes in the
ground, five or six feet deep, covered with heavy
timbers banked over with earth, the entrance facing
opposite the batteries from which the shells were
fired. They made these bomb-proofs safe, at least,
and thither the family repaired when heavy shelling
commenced. General Lee seemed to recognize that
no part of the city was safe, for he immediately
ordered the removal of all the hospitals, under the
care of Petersburg's esteemed physician, Dr. John
Herbert Claiborne. There were three thousand
sick and wounded, many of them too ill to be
moved. A long, never-ending line of wagons, carts,
everything that could run on wheels, passed my
door, until there were no more to pass. We soon
learned the peculiar, deep boom of the one great gun
which bore directly upon us. The boys named it
"Long Tom." Sometimes for several weeks "Long
Tom" rested or sleptâ€”and would then make up for
lost time. And yet we yielded to no panic. The
children seemed to understand that it would be cowardly
to complain. One little girl cried out with fright
at an explosion; but her aunt, Mrs. Gibson, took her
in her arms, and said: "My dear, you cannot make
it harder for other people! If you feel very much
afraid, come to me, and I will clasp you close, but
you mustn't cry."
</p>

<p>
Charles Campbell, the historian, lived near us, at
the Anderson Seminary. He cleared out the large
coal cellar, which was fortunately dry, spread rugs
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_281' name='Page_281' href='#Page_281'>281</a></span>
on the floor, and furnished it with lounges and
chairs. There we took refuge when the firing was
unbearable. Some of our neighbors piled bags of
sand around their houses, and thus made them
bomb-proof.
</p>

<p>
The Rev. Dr. Hoge, who had come South from
the Brick Church, New York, of which he had been
pastor, was lying ill and dying a few miles from
Petersburg, and my friend Mrs. Bland invited me
to accompany her to visit him. She had borrowed
an ambulance from General Bushrod Johnson.
</p>

<p>
We made our call upon our sick friend, and were
on our return when we were suddenly startled by
heavy firing. The ambulance driver was much excited,
and began to pour forth in broken English a
torrent of abuse of the Confederacy. As we were
near home, we kept silence, thinking that, if he grew
more offensive, we could leave him and walk. Mrs.
Bland undertook to reason with him.
</p>

<p>
"What is your grievance?" she inquired. "Perhaps
we might see the colonel and arrange a better
place for youâ€”some transfer, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Nevare! nevare!" said our man, "I transfare
to my own koontree! I make what you callâ€”'desairt.'
Mon Dieu! dey now tell me I fight for
neeger! Frenshman nevare fight for neeger."
</p>

<p>
All this time the guns were booming away, and
clouds of smoke were drifting toward us. We were
glad to arrive at my door.
</p>

<p>
It was closed. There was not a soul in the house.
One of the chimneys had been knocked down, and
the bricks lay in a heap on the grass. I thought of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_282' name='Page_282' href='#Page_282'>282</a></span>
Mr. Campbell's bomb-proof cellar; there we found
my children, and there we remained until the paroxysmal
shelling ceased.
</p>

<p>
One night, after a long, hot day, we were so tired
we slept soundly. I was awakened by Eliza Page,
standing trembling beside me. She pulled me out
of bed and hurriedly turned to throw blankets
around the children. The furies were let loose!
The house was literally shaking with the concussion
from the heavy guns. We were in the street, on our
way to our bomb-proof cellar, when a shell burst not
more than fifty feet before us. Fire and fragments
rose like a fountain in the air and fell in a shower
around us. Not one of my little family was hurt.
</p>

<p>
Another time a shell fell in our own yard and
buried itself in the earth. My baby was not far
away, in her nurse's arms. The little creature was
fascinated by the shells. The first word she ever
uttered was an attempt to imitate them. "Yonder
comes that bird with the broken wing," the servants
would say. The shells made a fluttering sound as
they traversed the air, descending with a frightful
hiss, to explode or be buried in the earth. When
they exploded in midair by day, a puff of smoke,
white as an angel's wing, would drift away, and the
particles would patter down like hail. At night,
the track of the shell and its explosion were precisely
similar in sound, although not in degree, to
our Fourth of July rockets, except that they were
fired, not upward, but in a slanting direction. I
never felt afraid of them! I was brought up to believe
in predestination. Courage, after all, is much
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_283' name='Page_283' href='#Page_283'>283</a></span>
a matter of nerves. My neighbors, Mr. and Mrs.
Gibson and Mrs. Meade, agreed with me, and we
calmly elected to remain in town. There was no
place of safety accessible to us. Mr. Branch
removed his family, and, as far as I knew, none
other of my friends remained throughout the
summer.
</p>

<p>
Not far from the door ran a sunken street, with a
hill, through which it was cut, rising each side of it.
Into this hill the negroes burrowed, hollowing out a
small space, where they sat all day on mats, knitting,
and selling small cakes made of sorghum and flour,
and little round meat pies. I might have been
tempted to invest in the latter except for a slight
circumstance. I saw a dead mule lying on the
common, and out of its side had been cut a very
neat, square chunk of flesh!
</p>

<p>
With all our starvation we never ate rats, mice, or
mule-meat. We managed to exist on peas, bread,
and sorghum. We could buy a little milk, and we
mixed it with a drink made from roasted and ground
corn. The latter, in the grain, was scarce. Mr.
Campbell's children picked up the grains wherever
the army horses were fed.
</p>

<p>
My little boys never complained, but Theo, who
had insisted upon returning to me from his uncle's
safe home in the country, said one day: "Mamma,
I have a queer feeling in my stomach! Oh, no! it
doesn't ache the least bit, but it feels like a nutmeg
grater."
</p>

<p>
Poor little laddie! His machinery needed oiling.
And pretty soon his small brother fell ill with fever.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_284' name='Page_284' href='#Page_284'>284</a></span>
My blessed Dr. Withers obtained a permit for me
to get a pint of soup every day from the hospital,
and one day there was a joyful discovery. In the
soup was a drumstick of chicken!
</p>

<p>
"I cert'nly hope I'll not get well," the little man
shocked me by saying.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, is it as bad as that?" I sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Why," he replied, "my soup will be stopped if
I get better!"
</p>

<p>
Just at this juncture, when things were as bad
as could be, my husband brought home to tea the
Hon. Pierre SoulÃ©, General D. H. Hill, and General
Longstreet. I had bread and a little tea, the
latter served in a yellow pitcher without a handle.
Mrs. Campbell, hearing of my necessity, sent me a
small piece of bacon.
</p>

<p>
When we assembled around the table, I lifted my
hot pitcher by means of a napkin, and offered my
tea, pure and simple, allowing the guests to use their
discretion in regard to a spoonful or two of very
dark brown sugar.
</p>

<p>
"This is a great luxury, Madam," said Mr. SoulÃ©,
with one of his gracious bows, "a good cup of tea."
</p>

<p>
We talked that night of all that was going wrong
with our country, of the good men who were constantly
relieved of their commands, of all the mistakes
we were making.
</p>

<p>
"Mistakes!" said General Hill, bringing his
clenched fist down upon the table, "I could forgive
mistakes! I cannot forgive lies! I could get along
if we could <i>only</i>, <i>only</i> ever learn the truth, the real
truth." But he was very personal and used much
stronger words than these.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_285' name='Page_285' href='#Page_285'>285</a></span>
</p>

<p>
They talked and talked, these veterans and the
charming, accomplished diplomat, until one of them
inquired the hour. I raised a curtain.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," I said, "the sun is rising. You
must now breakfast with us." They declined. They
had supped!
</p>

<p>
I had the misfortune early in June to fall ill, with
one of the sudden, violent fevers which cannot be
arrested, but must "run its course" for a certain
number of days. I was delirious from this fever,
and wild with the idea that a battle was raging
within hearing. I fancied I could hear the ring of
the musket as it was loaded! Possibly my quickened
senses had really heard, for a fierce battle was
going on at Port Walthall, a station on the Richmond
and Petersburg railroad, six miles distant.
General Butler had landed at Bermuda Hundred
and had been sent by General Grant to lead a
column against Richmond on the south side of the
James and to coÃ¶perate with forces from the Wilderness.
Butler had reached Swift Creek, there to
be met by General Johnson, and repulsed as
far as Walthall Junction on the railroad. The
following day there was a hotly contested battle at
close quarters, continued on the next, when our
men, although greatly outnumbered by Butler's
forces, drove these back to their base on the James
River. All this time my excited visions were of
battle and soldiers, culminating at last by the presence
of one soldier, leaning wearily on his sabre in
my own room. I did not recognize the soldier, but
memory still holds his attitude of grief as he looked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_286' name='Page_286' href='#Page_286'>286</a></span>
at me, and the sound of his voice as he answered
my question, "Where have you been all this time?"
with, "In more peril than in all my life before."
</p>

<p>
But the fever crisis was passing even then, and
I was soon well enough to learn more. This was
another of the well-planned schemes for taking Richmond,
another of the failures which drew from
Lincoln the gravely humorous reply, when application
was made to him for a pass to go to
Richmond:â€”
</p>

<p>
"I don't know about that; I have given passes
to about two hundred and fifty thousand men to go
there during the last two or three years, and not one
of them has got there yet."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Claiborne went out to this Walthall battle-field
to help the wounded, taking with him surgeons and
ambulances. A dreadful sight awaited him. Bodies
of dead men, Federal and Confederate, lay piled together
in heaps. On removing some of these to
discover if any one of them might be still alive, a
paper dropped from the pocket of a young lieutenant,
written in German to a lady in Bremen.
Upon reading it, Dr. Claiborne found it was addressed
to his betrothed. He told her that his term
of service having expired, he would soon leave for
New York City, and he gave her the street and number
where she should meet him on her arrival in this
country. This was his last fight, into which he went
no doubt voluntarily, as he was about to leave the
army. Doubtless the blue-eyed <i><span lang="de_DE">MÃ¤dchen</span></i> looked
long for him on the banks of the Weser! The doctor
indorsed the sad news on the letter, and sent it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_287' name='Page_287' href='#Page_287'>287</a></span>
through the lines. Perhaps it reached her, or perhaps
she is telling her story this day to other blue
eyes on the Weser, eyes that look up and wonder
she could ever have been young, lovely, and the
promised bride of a gallant Union officer.
</p>

<p>
The Confederate government utterly neglected
the praise and distinction so freely awarded by other
nations in time of war, for deeds of gallantry and
valor. Says Major Stiles: "Not only did I never
see or hear of a promotion on the field, but I do not
believe such a thing ever occurred in any army of
the Confederacy from the beginning to the end of
the war. Indeed, I am confident it never did; for,
incredible as it may appear, even Lee himself did
not have the power to make such promotion. I
never saw or heard of a medal or a ribbon being
pinned on a man's jacket, or even so much as a
man's name being read out publicly in orders of
gallantry in battle."<a name='FA_18' id='FA_18' href='#FN_18' class='fnanchor'>[18]</a>
</p>

<p>
Hanging in my husband's library, among other
war relics, is a heavy silver medal, representing in
high relief a soldier charging a cannon. On the
obverse side is a laurel wreath, space for a name,
and the words, "Distinguished for courage: U. S.
Colored Troops." No such medal was ever given
by our government to its hardly used, poorly paid
private soldiers. Some of them fought through the
war. They starved and froze in the trenches during
that last dreadful winter, but no precious star or
ribbon was awarded, to be hung with the sabre or
musket and venerated by generations yet to come.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' name='Page_288' href='#Page_288'>288</a></span>
Among my few preserved papers I have two in
faded ink. One is signed Bushrod Johnson, the
other D. H. Hill. The latter says: "The victory
at Walthall Junction was greatly due to General
Roger A. Pryor. But for him it is probable we
might have been surprised and defeated." The
other from General Johnson runs at length: "At
the most critical juncture General Roger A. Pryor
rendered me most valuable service, displaying great
zeal, energy, and gallantry in reconnoitring the positions
of the enemy, arranging my line of battle, and
rendering successful the operations and movements
of the conflict." At General Johnson's request my
husband served with him during the midsummer.
Such letters I have in lieu of medal or ribbon,â€”a
part only of much of similar nature; but less was
given to many a man who as fitly deserved recognition.
</p>

<p>
My General, who had been in active service in all
the events around Petersburg, was now requested by
General Lee to take with him a small squad of men,
and learn something of the movements of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
"Grant knows all about me," he said, "and I
know too little about Grant. You were a schoolboy
here, General, and have hunted in all the bypaths
around Petersburg. Knowing the country
better than any of us, you are the best man for this
important duty."
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, armed with a pass from General Lee,
my husband set forth on his perilous scouting
expedition, sometimes being absent a week at a time.
One morning, very early, he entered my room.
</p>

<p>
"I am dead for want of sleep," he said. "I was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_289' name='Page_289' href='#Page_289'>289</a></span>
obliged to take some prisoners. They are coming
in under guard, and you must give them a good
breakfast." As he walked out of the room to find a
quiet corner, he called back, "Be sure, now! Feed
my prisoners, if all the rest of us lose our breakfast."
</p>

<p>
He had suggested the only way in which he could
be obeyed.
</p>

<p>
Five forlorn blue-coated soldiers soon appeared,
and lay down under the trees. Presently they were
all asleep. I called my little family together. We
had only a small pail of meal. Would they be willing
to give it to these poor prisoners?
</p>

<p>
They were willing, never fear; but I had trouble
with John. He grew very sullen when I ordered
him to bake the bread for Yankee prisoners in five
small loaves. I promised to send out for more provisions
later, and finally he yielded, but with an ill
grace. When the hot loaves were on the table,
flanked by sweetened corn-coffee, I deputed Paterson
Gibson, my neighbor's kindly young son, to waken
my guests. This was no easy matter.
</p>

<p>
"Come, now, Yank," said Pat, "get up and eat
your breakfast. Come now! Cheer up! We'll
send you home pretty soon."
</p>

<p>
We left them alone at their repast. It occurred
to me they might try to escape, and I heartily
wished they would. But after an hour they were
marched away, we knew not whither.
</p>

<p>
On July 30th occurred the dreadful explosion of
the mine which the enemy had tunnelled under our
line of fortifications.
</p>

<p>
A little after four in the morning the city was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_290' name='Page_290' href='#Page_290'>290</a></span>
roused by the most awful thunderâ€”like nothing I
can imagine, except, perhaps, the sudden eruption of a
volcano. This was the explosion of a mine tunnelled
by General Grant under our works. Instantly the
unhappy residents of the town poured into the
street and out on the road, anywhere to escape
what we supposed to be an earthquake. No words
can adequately describe this horror! We lost a
part of our line. Colonel Paul, a member of
Beauregard's staff, was sent to inform General Lee
of the disaster, and bore back his orders that the
line must be at once recaptured. As the colonel
passed his father's house, he ran in and found the
old gentleman's hand on the bell-rope to summon
his household to family prayers.
</p>

<p>
"Stay, my son, and join us at prayers," said the
old man. "Get some breakfast with your mother
and me." The colonel could not pause. He
must leave this peaceful home, and bear his part in
protecting it.
</p>

<p>
When the veterans meet to-day for their camp-fire
talk, it is of the "battle of the Crater," the
shocking incidents of which cannot be told to gentle
ears, that they speak most frequently. The fountain
of fire that shot up to heaven bore with it the
dismembered bodies of man made in God's own
image. Then infuriated men, black and white, leaped
into the chasm and mingled in an orgy of carnage.
No one has ever built on that field. Nature smooths
its scars with her gentle hand, but no dwelling of man
will ever rest there while this tragedy is remembered.
</p>

<p>
On May 3d, 1887, Federal and Confederate veterans
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_291' name='Page_291' href='#Page_291'>291</a></span>
met on this spot and clasped hands together.
Since then the Confederates have met there again
and again. Each one has some story to tell of
heroism, of devotion, and the stories are not always
tragic. Some of them have been gleaned from the
experiences of the boys in blue.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Bowley of the Northern army delivered
an address before the California commandery
of the Loyal Legion of the United States, and
quotes from the address of a negro preacher to his
fellows just before the explosion of the crater. He
was sergeant of a company of negroes, and thus
exhorted them:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Now, men, dis is gwine to be a gret fight, de
gretest we seen yit; gret things is 'pending on dis
fight; if we takes Petersburg, mos' likely we'll take
Richmond an' 'stroy Lee's army an' close de wah.
Eb'ry man had orter liff up his soul in pra'r for a
strong heart. Oh! 'member de pore colored people
ober dere in bondage. Oh! 'member dat Gin'ral

all de gret gin'rals is right ober yander a watchin' ye;
an' 'member <i>I'se</i> a watchin' ye an 'any skulker is a
gwine ter git a prod ob dis ba'netâ€”you heah me!"
</p>

<p>
Words than which, except for the closing sentence,
I know none more pathetic.

<h2>
CHAPTER XIX
<br />
<span class="s05">BEHIND LEE'S LINES</span>
</h2>

<p>
The month of August in the besieged city passed
like a dream of terror. The weather was
intensely hot and dry, varied by storms of
thunder and lightningâ€”when the very heavens
seemed in league with the thunderbolts of the
enemy. Our region was not shelled continuously.
One shot from "our own gun," as we learned to
call it, would be fired as if to let us know our places;
this challenge would be answered from one of our
batteries, and the two would thunder away for five
or six hours. We always sought shelter in Mr.
Campbell's bomb-proof cellar at such times, and the
negroes would run to their own "bum-proofs," as
they termed the cells hollowed under the hill.
</p>

<p>
Agnes wrote from Richmond, August 26, 1864:â€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"You dear, obstinate little woman! What did I tell
you? I implored you to get away while you could, and
now you are waiting placidly for General Grant to blow
you up. That awful crater! Do the officers around you
consider it honorable warfare to dig and mine under a
man and blow him up while he is asleepâ€”before he has
time to get his musket? I always thought an open field
and a fair fight, with the enemy in front at equal chances,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_293' name='Page_293' href='#Page_293'>293</a></span>
was the American idea of honest, manly warfare. To
my mind this is the most awful thing that could be imagined.
There is a strong feeling among the people I meet
that the hour has come when we should consider the lives
of the few men left to us. Why let the enemy wipe us
off the face of the earth? Should this feeling grow, nothing
but a great victory can stop it. Don't you remember
what Mr. Hunter said to us in Washington? 'You may
sooner check with your bare hand the torrent of Niagara
than stop this tidal wave of secession.' <i>I</i> am for a tidal
wave of peaceâ€”and I am not alone. Meanwhile we
are slowly starving to death. Here, in Richmond, if we
can afford to give $11 for a pound of bacon, $10 for a
small dish of green corn, and $10 for a watermelon, we
can have a dinner of three courses for four persons. Hampton's
cavalry passed through town last week, amid great
excitement. Every man as he trotted by was cutting and
eating a watermelon, and throwing the rinds on the heads
of the little negro boys who followed in crowds on either
side of the street. You wouldn't have dreamed of warâ€”such
shouting and laughing from everybody. The contrasts
we constantly see look like insanity in our people.
The President likes to call attention to the fact that we
have no beggars on our streets, as evidence that things are
not yet desperate with us. He forgets our bread riot which
occurred such a little while ago. That pale, thin woman
with the wan smile haunts me. Ah! these are the people
who suffer the consequence of all that talk about slavery in
the territories you and I used to hear in the House and
Senate Chamber. Somebody, somewhere, is mightily to
blame for all this business, but it isn't you nor I, nor yet
the women who did not really deserve to have Governor
Letcher send the mayor to read the Riot Act to them.
They were only hungry, and so a thousand of them loaded
some carts with bread for their children. You are not to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_294' name='Page_294' href='#Page_294'>294</a></span>
suppose I am heartless because I run on in this irrelevant
fashion. The truth is, I am so shocked and disturbed I am
hysterical. It is all so awful.

<p>
My husband sent me a note by his courier, one
hot August day, to tell me that his old aide, Captain
Whitner, having been wounded, was now discharged
from the hospital, but was much too weak for service
in the trenches, so he had obtained for the captain
leave of absence for two weeks, and had sent
him to me to be built up. On the moment the sick
man appeared in an ambulance. I was glad to see
him, but a gaunt spectre arose before my imagination
and sternly suggested: "Built up, forsooth!
And pray, what are you to build him up with?
You can no more make a man without food than
the Israelites could make bricks without straw."
</p>

<p>
However, the captain had brought a ration of
bacon and meal, with promise of more to come. I
bethought me of the flourishing garden of my neighbor,
whose onions and beets were daily gathered for
her own family. I wrote a very pathetic appeal for
my wounded Confederate soldier, now threatened
with scurvy for want of fresh food, and I fully expected
she would be moved by my eloquence and
her own patriotism to grant me a daily portion from
her garden. She answered that she would agree to
send me a dish of vegetables fourteen days for fourteen
dollars. Gold was then selling at the rate of
twenty-five dollars in our paper currency for one
dollar in gold, so the dish was not a very costly one.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_295' name='Page_295' href='#Page_295'>295</a></span>
But when it appeared it was a very small dish indeed,â€”two
beets or four onions. HomÅ“opathic as were
the remedial agents, they helped to cure the captain.
</p>

<p>
One morning, late in August, Eliza came early to
my bedside. I started up in alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Shelling again?" I asked her.
</p>

<p>
"Worse," said Eliza.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, tell me quickâ€”is the Generalâ€”"
</p>

<p>
"No, no, honey," said my kind nurse, laying a
detaining hand upon me. "You cert'nly sleep
sound! Didn't you hear a stir downstairs in the
night? Well, about midnight somebody hallooed
to the kitchen, and John ran out. There stood a
man on horseback and a dead soldier lying before
him on the saddle. He said to John, 'Boy, I know
General Pryor would not refuse to take in my dead
brother.'
</p>

<p>
"John ran up to my room and asked me what he
must do. 'Take him in,' I told him. 'Marse
Roger will never forgive you if you turn him away.'"
</p>

<p>
"You were perfectly right," I said, beginning to
dress myself. "Where is he?"
</p>

<p>
"In the parlor," said Eliza. "He had a manservant
with him. John brought in his own cot,
and he is lying on it. His brother is in there, and
his man, both of them."
</p>

<p>
The children were hushed by their nurse's story,
and gathered under the shade in the yard. When
breakfast was served, I sent John to invite my guest
in. He returned with answer that "the captain
don' feel like eatin' nothin'."
</p>

<p>
"Captain?" I asked.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_296' name='Page_296' href='#Page_296'>296</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"No'm, he ain't a captain, but his dead brother
was. He was Captain Spann of South Carolina or
Georgia, I forget which. His man came into the
kitchen for hot water to shave his dead master, but
I didn't ask many questions 'cause I saw he was
troubled."
</p>

<p>
I went out to my ever blooming rose and found
it full of cool, dewy blossoms. I cut an armful,
and knocked at the parlor door myself. It was
opened by a haggard, weary-looking soldier, who
burst into tears at seeing me. I took his hand and
essayed to lead him forth, but he brokenly begged
I would place the roses upon his brother's breast.
"Will you, for the sake of his poor wife and
mother?"
</p>

<p>
Very calm was the face of the dead officer. His
servant and his brother had shaven and cared for
him. His dark hair was brushed from a noble
brow, and I could see that his features were regular
and refined.
</p>

<p>
I persuaded the lonely watcher to go with John
to an upper room, to bathe and rest a few minutes;
but he soon descended and joined us at our frugal
breakfast, and then Mr. Gibson, my good rector,
came in to help and advise, and in the evening my
husband returned, much gratified that we had received
and comforted the poor fellow.
</p>

<p>
As August drew to a close, I began to perceive
that I could no longer endure the recurrence of such
scenes; and I learned with great relief that my
brother-in-law had moved his family to North Carolina
and had placed Cottage Farm, three miles
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' name='Page_297' href='#Page_297'>297</a></span>
distant from the besieged city, at my disposal.
Accordingly, I wrote to General Bushrod Johnson,
requesting an army wagon to be sent me early the
next morning, and all night was spent in packing
and preparing to leave. I had collected needful
furniture when I moved into town eight months
before.
</p>

<p>
The wagon did not come at the specified hour.
All day we waited, all the next night (without our
beds), and the next day. As I looked out of the
window in the twilight, hoping and watching, the
cannonading commenced with vigor, and a line of
shells rose in the air, describing luminous curves
and breaking into showers of fragments. Our gun
will be next, I thought, and for the first time my
strength forsook me, and I wept over the hopeless
doom which seemed to await us. Just then I heard
the wheels below my window, and there was my
wagon with four horses.
</p>

<p>
We were all bestowed, bag and baggage, in a few
minutes, and were soon safely beyond shell fire. I
did not know until then how great had been the
strain of keeping up under fire for three months.
I literally "went all to pieces," trembling as though
I had a chill. When we arrived at Cottage Farm,
my driver allowed John, Eliza, and my little boys to
unload in the road before the lawn, and then calmly
turned his horses' heads and drove away.
</p>

<p>
It was nine o'clock, we had no lights, we had no
strength to lift our packages into the house. John
advised that he should remain on guard during the
night, and that some blankets should be spread for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_298' name='Page_298' href='#Page_298'>298</a></span>
us in the cottage, and we proceeded to carry out
this plan. In a few minutes, however, half a dozen
soldiers came up, and one of their officers pleasantly
greeted us as "welcome neighbors," for their company
was encamped near us. They had seen our
plight and had come to "set things to rights," also
to assure us of protection.
</p>

<p>
About twelve o'clock we found ourselves comfortable.
Our beds were put up, our boxes were
all under cover. John's commissariat yielded some
biscuits, there was a well of pure water near the
door. We were safe. We could sleep. No shell
could reach us!
</p>

<p>
The cool freshness of a lovely September morning
filled our hearts with life and hope. A large
circle of flowers, chrysanthemums, dahlias, and late-blooming
roses surrounded the carriage drive to the
door, a green lawn stretched to the limits of a large
yard in the rear, and beyond this a garden with a
few potatoes to dig, and an apple tree in fruit which
the soldiers had respected. John and the little
boys were in fine spirits. They laid plans for a
cow, chickens, ducks, and pigeons. The cow was
purchased at once from a neighboring farmer, was
named Rose, and was installed in a shelter attached
to the kitchen, where John could protect her from
marauders.
</p>

<p>
"'Cause," said John, "I knows soldiers! They
get up before day and milk your cow under your
very eyebrows. Ain't you hear about Gen'al Lee
in Pennsylvania? The old Dutch farmers gave him
Hail Columbia because his soldiers milked their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_299' name='Page_299' href='#Page_299'>299</a></span>
cows. Gen'al Lee could keep 'em from stealin'
horses, but the queen o' England herself couldn't
stop a soldier when he hankers after milk. An' he
don't need no pail, neither; he can milk in his canteen
an' never spill a drop."
</p>

<p>
My brother had left two old family servants,
"Uncle Frank" and his wife "Aunt Jinny," as caretakers
of the premises; and to their dignified bearing,
supplemented by the presence of a company of
honorable soldiers, we were indebted for the unrifled
apple tree and the tiny potatoes, like marbles,
left after the autumn digging. "Aunt Jinny" also
had a few fowls. An egg for my baby was now
possible.
</p>

<p>
Her faithful Christian character had won for her
a high place in the esteem of the family. Uncle
Frank's manners were perfect,â€”polished, suave, and
conciliatory; but when judge and jury sat upon the
case of a culprit arraigned by him, his testimony
was apt to be challenged by his prisoner.
</p>

<p>
"You knows, Marse Robert, you can't b'lieve
ole Uncle Frank!"
</p>

<p>
"Frank always knows what he is talking about!
He is only more polite than the rest of you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Marse Robert, Gawd knows I hates to
fling dut at Uncle Frank, but he's a liar. He
sholy is! An' jist 'cause he's a <i>sweet</i> liar he gets we
all in trouble."
</p>

<p>
My father, the chaplain, soon joined us, his corps
having camped within riding distance. There was
an office in the yard, and there my father took up
his abode. His life was an active one among the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_300' name='Page_300' href='#Page_300'>300</a></span>
soldiers, and he was often absent for days at a time;
but I felt the protection of his occasional presence.
</p>

<p>
My husband was now employed, day and night,
often in peril, gleaning from every possible source
information for General Lee.
</p>

<p>
One day Theo and Roger ran in with stirring
news. They had seen General Lee dismount at
Mr. Turnbull's, a short distance on the road
beyond us, and had learned from Mr. Turnbull
himself that his house had been given to General
Lee for his headquarters, also that the General did
not require Mr. and Mrs. Turnbull to leave, and
that they were delighted to have the General.
</p>

<p>
The whole face of the earth seemed to change
immediately. Army wagons crawled unceasingly
along the highroad, just in front of our gate. All
was stir and life in the rear, where there was another
country road, and a short road connecting the two
passed immediately by the well near our house.
This, too, was constantly travelled; the whir of the
well-wheel never seemed to pause, day or night.
We soon had pleasant visitors, General A. P. Hill,
Colonel William Pegram, General Walker, General
Wilcox, and others. General Wilcox, an old friend
and comrade, craved permission to make his headquarters
on the green lawn in the rear of the house,
and my husband rejoiced at his presence and protection
for our little family.
</p>

<p>
In less than twenty-four hours I found myself
in the centre of a camp. The white tents of General
Wilcox's staff officers were stretched close to the
door.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_301' name='Page_301' href='#Page_301'>301</a></span>
</p>

<p>
When we left Washington, our library and pictures
had been sent to Petersburg, and had remained
there in a warehouse ever since. My father eagerly
advised us to set up the library and hang the pictures
in our new home at Cottage Farm.
</p>

<p>
"But suppose General Lee moves away," I
suggested.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, he will not move away! He is here
to protect Petersburg and Richmond. He will
never surrender either placeâ€”and, as I have tried
to impress upon you, the safest place for you on
this continent is in the rear of Lee's army."
</p>

<p>
So timber was brought for shelving the dining
room, and three thousand or more books were
arranged on the shelves. The parlor and the two
bedrooms (we had no more in the little cottage)
were hung with the pictures bought by my husband
when he was Minister to Greece. My favoriteâ€”the
Raffaello Morghen proof impression of the "Madonna
della Seggiola"â€”hung over the mantel in
the parlor, and to it I lifted weary eyes many a time
during the remaining days of the war. Sundry
delicate carvings were also in the boxes, with my
music. My sister had not taken her piano with her
to North Carolina. There were a baby-house and
toys in another box, and in a French trunk with
many compartments some evening dresses, at which
I did not even glance, well knowing I should not
need them. The trunk containing them was stored
in the cellar.
</p>

<p>
We were happier than we had been for a long time.
Things seemed to promise a little respite. To be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' name='Page_302' href='#Page_302'>302</a></span>
sure, Grant's army was in front of us; but if we
could only avoid a collision for a month or two, the
troops on both sides would go into winter quarters,
and everybody would have the rest so much needed
to fit them for the spring campaign.
</p>

<p>
"We are here for eight years,â€”not a day less,"
said my father, and he fully believed it.
</p>

<p>
That being the case, it behooved me to look after
the little boys' education. School books were found
for them. I knew "small Latin and less Greek," but
I gravely heard them recite lessons in the former;
and they never discovered the midnight darkness of
my mind as to mathematics.
</p>

<p>
I knew nothing of the strong line of fortifications
which General Grant was building at the back of the
farm, fortifications strengthened by forts at short
intervals. Our own lineâ€”visible from the gardenâ€”had
fewer forts, two of which, Fort Gregg and
Battery 45, protected our immediate neighborhood.
These forts occasionally answered a challenge, but
there was no attempt at a sally on either side.
</p>

<p>
The most painful circumstance connected with
our position was the picket firing at night, incessant,
like the dropping of hail, and harrowing from the
apprehension that many a man fell from the fire of
a picket. But, perhaps to reassure me, Captain
Lindsay and Captain Glover of General Wilcox's
staff declared that "pickets have a good time.
They fire, yes, for that is their business; but
while they load for the next volley, one will call
out, 'Hello, Reb,' be answered, 'Hello, Yank,' and
little parcels of coffee are thrown across in exchange
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' name='Page_303' href='#Page_303'>303</a></span>
for a plug of tobacco." After accepting this fiction
I could sleep better.
</p>

<p>
Nothing could better illustrate the fact that this
war was not a war of the men at the guns, than one
of General John B. Gordon's anecdotes.<a name='FA_19' id='FA_19' href='#FN_19' class='fnanchor'>[19]</a>
</p>

<p>
A short distance from Blandford was the strong
work on the Federal line called Fort Steadman. It
was determined to take this by assault. There were
obstructions in front of our lines which had to be removed.
The lines were so close this could only be
done under cover of darkness. Then there were
obstructions to be removed from the front of Fort
Steadman, and an immediate rush to be made before
the gunners could fire.
</p>

<p>
This delicate and hazardous duty was successfully
performed by General Gordon, near the close of
the war, and was the last time the stars and bars
were carried to aggressive assault.
</p>

<p>
About four o'clock in the morning our axemen
were quietly at work on our obstacle when the unavoidable
noise attracted the notice of a Federal
picket. In the black darkness he called out:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Hello there, Johnny Reb! What are you
making all that fuss about over there?"
</p>

<p>
Our men were leaning forward for the start, and
General Gordon was for a moment disconcerted; but
a rifleman answered in a cheerful voice:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Oh, never mind us, Yank! Lie down and go
to sleep! We are just gathering a little corn; you
know rations are mighty short over here!"
</p>

<p>
There was a patch of corn between the lines, some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' name='Page_304' href='#Page_304'>304</a></span>
still hanging on the stalks. After a few moments
there came back the kindly reply of the Yankee
picket:â€”
</p>

<p>
"All right, Johnny, go ahead and get your corn.
I won't shoot at you."
</p>

<p>
General Gordon was about to give the command
to go forward, when the rifleman showed some compunctions
of conscience for having used deception
which might result in the picket's death, by calling
out loudly:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Look out for yourself now, Yank! We're
going to shell the woods."
</p>

<p>
Such exhibitions of true kindness and comradeship
were not uncommon during the war.
</p>

<p>
On a hill a short distance off was the farmhouse
of "old Billy Green," as he was known to his
neighbors. He had a good wife, kind to me and to
everybody, and a fine-looking, amiable daughter,
Nannie Green. These were my only female acquaintances.
Nannie soon became an out-and-out
belleâ€”the only young lady in the neighborhood.
Tender songs were paraphrased in her honor; Ben
Bolt's Sweet Alice became "Sweet Nannie," and
"Sweet Annie of the Vale" easily became "Sweet
Nannie of the Hill." I was very stern with the
young officers around me, about Nannie Green.
She was a modest, dignified girl, and I did not
intend to have her spoiled, nor her father ridiculed.
</p>

<p>
I found some cut-glass champagne glasses in one
of my boxes. Every night a request would come
from Captain Lindsay, or Captain Glover, or some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_305' name='Page_305' href='#Page_305'>305</a></span>
other of my staff tenants, for a champagne glass.
At last I asked:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Why do you limit yourselves to one glass?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we don't drink from it. We have no wine,
you know."
</p>

<p>
It appeared upon investigation that they cut profile
pictures of Nannie Green out of paper, laid this
cut paper on another, weighting it down with bullets,
and turned the glass over it. As they sat around
the table smoking, each one would lift a little edge
of the glass and blow the smoke under it, shutting
down quickly. When the smoking was over, and
glass and paper were lifted, there was a pure white
silhouette of Nannie's face on an amber-colored
background, cameo-like in effect. The face would
be delicately shaded, soulful eyes added, andâ€”<i><span lang="fr_FR">voilÃ </span></i>!
</p>

<p>
"Why was I not to know this?" I asked sternly.
</p>

<p>
"Because we feared you would lend us no more
glasses."
</p>

<p>
"So it appears you all have a young lady's picture
without her consent?"
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" they pleaded. "Isn't she perfectly
welcome to ours?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you expect her to exchange, for something
she doesn't want, something which you <i>do</i> want?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, we think she might," said one, ruefully.
"If her shadow can comfort a poor fellow's cold and
lonely evening, she might spare it. She can't
possibly miss it."
</p>

<p>
I never refused to lend them the glasses.

<h2>
CHAPTER XX
<br />
<span class="s05">ARRIVING AT EXTREMITIES</span>
</h2>

<p>
My husband's duties kept him from home
several days at a time during the early
autumn, but now that the lines were drawn
so closely together, he could usually return to us
after reporting to General Lee at night. I had
ceased to feel anxious when he rode away in the
morning on his gray horse, Jubal Early. Jubal had
brought him safely through many a difficulty. Once
he found himself suddenly confronted by a small
company of Federals aligned for drill. He saluted,
as if he were an officer on inspection, rode gravely
past the line, and then Jubal's fleet feet dashed quite
out of range before the volley which followed the
discovery of his ruse.
</p>

<p>
One frosty morning I was writing letters,â€”to
Agnes, to my mother, to my little girls in Charlotte,
expressing the gratitude of my heart for the
new blessings of the hour,â€”when General Wilcox
entered, and took his accustomed stand before the
fire.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," he commenced, "is the General at
home?"
</p>

<p>
"No, General, he did not return last night."
</p>

<p>
"You are not uneasy?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_307' name='Page_307' href='#Page_307'>307</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit. He sometimes stops at Mrs. Friend's
when he is belated. She's his cousin, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Of course!" laughed the General. "All the
pretty women in Virginia are cousins to the Virginia
officers. Couldn't you naturalize a few unfortunates
who were not born in Virginia?"
</p>

<p>
I was sealing and stamping my letters, and looked
up without immediately answering his badinage. To
my surprise his face was pale and his lip quivering.
</p>

<p>
"You have to know it," said he. "The General
will not return. The Yankees caught him this
morning."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, impossible!" I exclaimed. "Jubal never
fails."
</p>

<p>
"Look out of the window," said the general.
</p>

<p>
There stood Jubal! A groom was removing his
saddle. General Wilcox most kindly hastened to
reassure me. "It will be all right," he declared.
"A little rest for the General, and we will soon
exchange him."
</p>

<p>
I was completely stunned. I had never expected
this. My head reeled. My heart sickened within
me.
</p>

<p>
As I sat thus, shivering beside the fire, I heard
the clank of spurs, and looked up. An officer was
at the door.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," he said, "General Lee sends you his
affectionate sympathies."
</p>

<p>
Through the open window I saw the General on
his horse, Traveller, standing at the well. He waited
until his messenger returned, and then rode slowly
toward the lines.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_308' name='Page_308' href='#Page_308'>308</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I had small hope of the speedy exchange promised
me by General Wilcox. From day to day he
reported the efforts made for my husband's release
and their failure. General Lee authorized a letter
to General Meade, detailing the circumstances of his
capture and requesting his release. General Meade
promptly refused to release him.
</p>

<p>
We naturally looked to the enemy for all information,
and although my husband had written me
a pencilled note at City Point on the inside of a
Confederate envelope, and had implored his guard
(a Federal officer) to have it inserted in a New York
paper, I did not receive it until thirty-one years
afterward. We soon had news, however, through
a despatch from the North Army Corps to the <i>New
York Herald</i>. The paper of November 30, 1864,
contained the following:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Yesterday a rebel officer made his appearance in
front of our lines, waving a paper for exchange. The
officer in charge of the picket, suddenly remembering
that Major Burrage, of the Thirty-sixth Massachusetts,
was taken prisoner some time since by the
enemy while on a similar errand, 'gobbled' the rebel,
who proved to be the famous Roger A. Pryor, ex-member
of Congress and ex-brigadier-general of Jeff
Davis's army. He protested vehemently against
what he styled a flagrant breach of faith on our part.
He was assured he was taken in retaliation for like
conduct on the part of his friends, and sent to General
Meade's headquarters for further disposition."
</p>

<p>
Press despatch to <i>Herald</i>, November 30, from
Washington, "Roger A. Pryor has been brought
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_309' name='Page_309' href='#Page_309'>309</a></span>
to Washington, and committed to the old Capitol
Prison."
</p>

<p>
<i>Herald</i>, December 1, 1864, "Pryor was ferried
over to Fort Lafayette, where he is now confined."
</p>

<p>
Then later I received a personal through <i>The
News</i>: "To Mrs. R. A. Pryor. Your husband is
in Fort Lafayette, where a friend and relative is permitted
to visit him.â€”[Signed] <span class="smcap">Mary Rhodes.</span>"
</p>

<p>
Not until December, 1864, could Colonel Ould
arrange to have a letter from me sent through the
lines. All letters from and to prisoners were examined
by Federal officials.
</p>

<p>
On the 20th of December I received a brief note
from Fort Lafayette: "My philosophy begins to
fail somewhat. In vain I seek some argument of
consolation. I see no chance of release. The conditions
of my imprisonment cut me off from every
resource of happiness."
</p>

<p>
I learned afterward that he was ill, and under the
care of a physician all winter, but he tried to write
as encouragingly as possible. In February, however,
he failed in health and spirits, but bore up
bravely:â€”
</p>

<p>
"I am as contented as is compatible with my condition.
My mind is ill at ease from my solicitude
for my family and my country. Every disaster
pierces my soul like an arrow; and I am afflicted
with the thought that I am denied the privilege of
contributing even my mite to the deliverance of â€”â€”.
How I envy my old comrades their hardships and
privations. I have little hope of an early exchange,
and you may be assured my mistrust is not without
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_310' name='Page_310' href='#Page_310'>310</a></span>
reason. <i>Except some special instance be employed to
procure my release, my detention here will be indefinite.</i>
I cannot be more explicit. While this is my conviction,
I wish it distinctly understood that I would
not have my government compromise any scruple
for the sake of my liberation. I am prepared for
any contingencyâ€”am fortified against any reverse
of fortune."
</p>

<p>
The problem now confronting me was this: How
could I maintain my children and myself? My
husband's rations were discontinued. My only
supply of food was from my father's ration as chaplain.
I had a part of a barrel of flour which a relative
had sent me from a county now cut off from
us. Quite a number of my old Washington servants
had followed me, to escape the shelling, but they
could not, of course, look to me for their support.
I frankly told John and Eliza my condition, but
they elected to remain. One day John presented
himself with a heart-broken countenance and a
drooping attitude of deep dejection. He had a sad
story to tell. The agent of the estate to which
he belonged was in town, and John had been
commissioned to inform me that all the slaves belonging
to the estate were to be immediately transferred
to a Louisiana plantation for safety. Those
of us who had hired these servants by the year were
to be indemnified for our loss.
</p>

<p>
"How do you feel about it, John?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
The poor fellow broke down. "It will kill me,"
he declared. "I'll soon die on that plantation."
</p>

<p>
All his affectionate, faithful service, all his hardships
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_311' name='Page_311' href='#Page_311'>311</a></span>
for our sakes, the Averill raid, rushed upon
my memory. I bade him put me in communication
with the agent. I found that I could save the boy
only by buying him. A large sum of gold was named
as the price. I unbuckled my girdle and counted
my handful of goldâ€”one hundred and six dollars.
These I offered to the agent (who was a noted negro
trader), and although it was far short of his figures,
he made out my bill of sale receipted.
</p>

<p>
When John appeared with smiling face he informed
me with his thanks that he belonged to me.
</p>

<p>
"You are a free man, John," I said. "I will make
out your papers and I can very easily arrange for
you to pass the lines."
</p>

<p>
"I know that," he said. "Marse Roger has
often told me I was a free man. I never will leave
you till I die. Papers indeed! Papers nothing! I
belong to youâ€”that's where I belong."
</p>

<p>
All that dreadful winter he was faithful to his
promise, cheerfully bearing, without wages, all the
privations of the time. Sometimes, when the last
atom of food was gone, he would ask for money,
sally forth with a horse and light cart, and bring in
peas and dried apples. Once a week we were allowed
to purchase the head of a bullock, horns and all,
from the commissary; and a small ration of rice was
allowed us by the government. A one-armed boy,
Alick, who had been reared in my father's family,
now wandered in to find his old master, and installed
himself as my father's servant.
</p>

<p>
The question that pressed upon me day and night
was: How, where, can I earn some money? to be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_312' name='Page_312' href='#Page_312'>312</a></span>
answered by the frightful truth that there could be
no opening for me anywhere, because I could not
leave my children.
</p>

<p>
One wakeful night, while I was revolving these
things, a sudden thought darted, unbidden, into my
sorely oppressed mind:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Why not open the trunk from Washington?
Something may be found there which can be sold."
</p>

<p>
At an early hour next morning John and Alick
brought the trunk from the cellar. Aunt Jinny,
Eliza, and the children gathered around. It proved
to be full of my old Washington finery. There were
a half-dozen or more white muslin gowns, flounced
and trimmed with Valenciennes lace, many yards;
there was a rich bayadere silk gown trimmed fully
with guipure lace; a green silk dress with gold
embroidery; a blue and silver brocade,â€”these last
evening gowns. There was a paper box containing
the shaded roses I had worn to Lady Napier's ball,
the ball at which Mrs. Douglas and I had dressed
alike in gowns of tulle. Another box held the garniture
of green leaves and gold grapes which had
belonged to the green silk; and still another the
blue and silver feathers for the brocade. An opera
cloak trimmed with fur; a long purple velvet cloak;
a purple velvet "coalscuttle" bonnet, trimmed with
white roses; a point lace handkerchief; Valenciennes
lace; Brussels lace; and at the bottom of the trunk
a package of <i><span lang="fr_FR">ciel</span></i> blue zephyr, awakening reminiscences
of a passion which I had cherished for
knitting shawls and "mariposas" of zephyr,â€”such
was the collection I had discovered.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_313' name='Page_313' href='#Page_313'>313</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The velvet cloak had come to grief. Somebody
had put the handsome books President Pierce had
given me into this box, for special safe-keeping;
and all these years the cloak had cushioned the
books so that they made no inroads upon the other
articles, and had given up its own life in their protection.
Not an inch of the garment was ever fit
for use. It was generously printed all over with the
large cords and tassels of its own trimming.
</p>

<p>
These were my materials. I must make them
serve for the support of my family.
</p>

<p>
I ripped all the lace from the evening gowns, and
made it into collars and undersleeves. John found
an extinct dry-goods store where clean paper boxes
could be had.
</p>

<p>
My first instalment of lace collars was sent to
Price's store in Richmond and promptly sold. Mr.
Price wrote me that all of my articles would find
purchasers. There were ladies in Richmond who
could afford to buy, and the Confederate court
offered opportunities for display.
</p>

<p>
Admiral Porter records the capture of a blockade-runner
whose valuable goods included many
commissions for "ladies at court. In the cabin of
the vessel," says the admiral, "was a pile of bandboxes
in which were charming little bonnets marked
with the owners' names. It would have given me
much pleasure to have forwarded them to their destination"
(the admiral had ever a weakness for
Southern ladies) "but the laws forbade our giving
aid and comfort to the enemy, so all the French
bonnets, cloaks, shoes, and other feminine <i><span lang="fr_FR">bric-Ã -brac</span></i>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_314' name='Page_314' href='#Page_314'>314</a></span>
had to go to New York for condemnation by
the Admiralty Court, and were sold at public auction.
</p>

<p>
"These bonnets, laces, and other vanities rather
clashed with the idea I had formed of the Southern
ladies, as I heard that all they owned went to the
hospitals, and that they never spent a cent on their
personal adornment; but human nature," sagely
opines the admiral, "is the same the world over,
and ladies will indulge in their little vanities in spite
of war and desolation."<a name='FA_20' id='FA_20' href='#FN_20' class='fnanchor'>[20]</a> To these vanities I now
found myself indebted.
</p>

<p>
The zeal with which I worked knew no pause.
I needed no rest. General Wilcox, who was in the
saddle until a late hour every night, said to me,
"Your candle is the last light I see at nightâ€”the
first in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"I should never sleep," I told him.
</p>

<p>
One day I consulted Eliza about the manufacture
of a Confederate candle. We knew how to make
itâ€”by drawing a cotton rope many times through
melted wax, and then winding it around a bottle.
We could get wax, but our position was an exposed
one. Soldiers' tents were close around us, and we
scrupulously avoided any revelation of our needs,
lest they should deny themselves for our sakes.
Eliza thought we might avail ourselves of the absence
of the officers, and finish our work before
they returned. We made our candle; but that
night, as I sat sewing beside its dim, glow-worm
light, I heard a step in the hall, and a hand, hastily
thrust out, placed a brown paper parcel on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_315' name='Page_315' href='#Page_315'>315</a></span>
piano near the door. It was a soldier's ration of
candles!
</p>

<p>
After I had converted all my laces into collars,
cuffs, and sleeves, and had sold my silk gowns,
opera cloak, and point lace handkerchiefs, I devoted
myself to trimming the edges of the artificial flowers,
and separating the long wreaths and garlands into
clusters for hats and <i><span lang="fr_FR">bouquets de corsage</span></i>.
</p>

<p>
Eliza and the children delighted in this phase of
my work, and begged to assist,â€”all except Aunt
Jinny.
</p>

<p>
"Honey," she said, "don't you think, in these
times of trouble, you might do better than tempt
them po' young lambs in Richmond to worship the
golden calf and bow down to mammon? We prays
not to be led into temptation, and you sho'ly is
leadin' 'em into vanity."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe so, Aunt Jinny, but I must sell all I
can. We have to be clothed, you know, war or no
war."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my chile, that's so; but we're told to consider
the lilies. Gawd Almighty tells us we must
clothe ourselves in the garment of righteousness,
and Heâ€”"
</p>

<p>
"You always 'pear to be mighty intimate with
God A'mighty," interrupted Eliza, in great wrath.
"Now you just go 'long home an' leave my mistis
to her work. How would <i>you</i> look with nothin' on
but a garment of righteousness?"
</p>

<p>
When I had stripped the pretty muslin gowns of
their trimmings, what could be done with the gowns
themselves? Finally I resolved to embroider them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_316' name='Page_316' href='#Page_316'>316</a></span>
with the blue zephyr. I rolled the edges of the
flounces, and edged them delicately with a spiral
line of blue. I traced with blue a dainty vine of
forget-me-nots on bodice and sleeves, with a result
that was simply ravishing!
</p>

<p>
My first purchase was a barrel of flour, for which I
paid thirteen hundred dollars. John made hot biscuits
three times a day thereafter. As the winter wore
on, and the starvation became stern in the army, a soldier
would occasionally bring to the kitchen his ration
of a small square of beef to be cooked, or <i>eight grains
of coffee</i> to trade with John for a few biscuits. I
sternly forbade the trade, and ordered John to grind
the coffee in the owner's presence, mix it with our
toasted corn, and give him the biscuits, with a good,
strengthening drink. Often a brown hand would
place a tiny bundle on the piano, as the donor passed
through the hall, and my heart would ache to find
it contained a soldier's ration of coffee. My dear
father had friends among his old parishioners who
never allowed him to do without his coffeeâ€”a necessity
for a man who never, under any circumstances,
fortified his strength with ardent spirits. He was
almost fanatical on the total abstinence subject.
</p>

<p>
Of course I could not command shoes for my
boys. I made them of carpet lined with flannel for
my baby. I could in one day make a pair which
she wore out in three! A piece of bronze morocco
fell into my hands, of which I made a pair of boots
for my little daughter, Mary, and out of an old
leather pocket-book and two or three leather bags
which Alick found in his prowling over the fields, a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_317' name='Page_317' href='#Page_317'>317</a></span>
soldier-shoemaker contrived shoes for each of the
boys.
</p>

<p>
My own prime necessity was for the steel we
women wear in front of our stays. I suffered so
much for want of this accustomed support, that
Captain Lindsay had a pair made for me by the
government gunsmith.
</p>

<p>
The time came when the salable contents of the
Washington trunk were all gone. I then cut up
my husband's dress-coat, and designed well-fitting
ladies' gloves, with gauntlets made of the watered
silk lining. Of an interlining of gray flannel I made
gray gloves, and this glove manufacture yielded
me hundreds of dollars. Thirteen small fragments
of flannel were left after the gloves were finished.
Of these, pieced together, I made a pair of drawers
for my Willyâ€”my youngest boy.
</p>

<p>
The lines around us were now so closely drawn
that my father returned home after short absences
of a day or two. But we were made anxious, during
a heavy snow early in December, by a more
prolonged absence. Finally he appeared, on foot,
hatless, and exhausted. He had been captured by
a party of cavalrymen. He had told them of his
non-combatant position, but when he asked for release,
they shook their heads. At night they all
prepared to bivouac upon the ground, assigned to
him a sheltered spot, gave him a good supper and
blankets, and left him to his repose. As the night
wore on and all grew still, he raised his head cautiously
to reconnoitre, and to his surprise found
himself at some distance from the guardâ€”but his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_318' name='Page_318' href='#Page_318'>318</a></span>
horse tied to a tree within the circle around the fire.
My father took the hint, and quietly walked away
unchallenged. "Which proves, my dear," he said,
"that a clergyman is not worth as much as a good
horse in time of war."

<h2>
CHAPTER XXI
<br />
<span class="s05">A WINTER OF WANT</span>
</h2>

<p>
I resolved to give my family a Christmas
dinner. John invented a method of making
a perfectly satisfactory pie out of sorghum
molasses, thickened with a little flour, mixed with
walnut meats, and baked in a "raised" crust. He
prepared a number of these. I bought a piece of
corned beef for fifty dollars. This was boiled with
peas. But just as we were about to gather around
the table, we saw a forlorn company of soldiers passing
the door. They had gone out on some raid a
week before. The snow was falling fast, the soldiers
walked wearily, with dejected countenances. "Boys,"
I said, "are you willing to send the dish of beef and
peas out to them?" They agreed, if only they
might carry it; and the brave little fellows liked
the pleasure they gave more than they would have
enjoyed the dinner. They were full of it for days
afterward.
</p>

<p>
We had grown very fond of some of the men
around us, and my boys were so rich in their companionship,
that they never complained of their privations.
They were good, wholesome comrades,
interested in our books and in the boys' studies.
Captain Lindsay and Captain Glover of General
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_320' name='Page_320' href='#Page_320'>320</a></span>
Wilcox's staff were great comforts. General A. P.
Hill and Colonel William Pegram came often to see
us. General Lee often passed the door on his way
to the lines, and paused to inquire concerning our
welfare. I established a little circulating library for
dear Colonel Pegram and our own officers. The
books were always faithfully returned, with warm
thanks for the comfort they gave.
</p>

<p>
The month of January brought us sleet and storm.
Our famine grew sterner every day. Poor little
Rose, my cow, could yield only one cupful of milk,
so small was her ration; but we never thought of
turning the faithful animal into beef. The officers
in my yard spared her something every day from the
food of their horses.
</p>

<p>
The days were so dark and cheerless, the news
from the armies at a distance so discouraging, it was
hard to preserve a cheerful demeanor for the sake
of the family. And now began the alarming tidings,
every morning, of the desertions during the night.
General Wilcox wondered how long his brigade would
hold together at the rate of fifty desertions every
twenty-four hours.
</p>

<p>
The common soldier had enlisted, not to establish
the right of secession, not for love of the slave,â€”he
had no slaves,â€”but simply to resist the invasion of
the South by the North, simply to prevent subjugation.
The soldier of the rank and file was not
always intellectual or cultivated. He cared little for
politics, less for slavery. He did care, however,
for his own soil, his own little farm, his own humble
home; and he was willing to fight to drive the invader
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_321' name='Page_321' href='#Page_321'>321</a></span>
from it. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation did
not stimulate him in the least. The negro, free or
slave, was of no consequence to him. His quarrel
was a sectional one, and he fought for his section.
</p>

<p>
In any war, the masses rarely trouble themselves
about the merits of the quarrel. Their pugnacity and
courage are aroused and stimulated by the enthusiasm
of their comrades, or by their own personal wrongs
and perils.
</p>

<p>
Now, in January, 1865, the common soldier perceived
that the cause was lost. He could read its
doom in the famine around him, in the faces of
his officers, in tidings from abroad. His wife and
children were suffering. His duty was now to them;
so he stole away in the darkness, and, in infinite
danger and difficulty, found his way back to his own
fireside. He deserted, but not to the enemy.
</p>

<p>
But what can we say of the soldier who remained
unflinchingly at his post <i>knowing</i> the cause was lost
for which he was called to meet death? Heroism
can attain no loftier height than this.
</p>

<p>
Sir Charles Napier,<a name='FA_21' id='FA_21' href='#FN_21' class='fnanchor'>[21]</a> in his campaign against the
robber tribes of Upper Scinde, found that the hills-men
had a custom of binding, with a scarlet thread,
the wrist of a leader who fell after some distinguished
act of courage. They thus honored the hand that
had wielded a valiant sword.
</p>

<p>
A party of eleven English soldiers were once separated
from their fellows, and mistook a signal for an
order to charge. The brave fellows answered with
a cheer. On a summit in front of them was a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_322' name='Page_322' href='#Page_322'>322</a></span>
breastwork manned by seventy of the foe. On they
went, charging up the fearful path, eleven against
seventy. There could be but one result. When
their comrades arrived to aid them, every one of the
British soldiers was deadâ€”and around <i>both</i> wrists
of every one was twined the red thread!
</p>

<p>
And so I am sure that to every man who fell in
that last hopeless fight, our brave foes will award the
red badge of honorâ€”as our own hearts will ever
strive to deserve it for their sakes.
</p>

<p>
The horror of military execution was now upon
us. Nothing so distressed my father and myself. Finally
General Lee offered the men who had deserted
a last opportunity to wipe out their disgrace and
escape the punishment of their crimes. He granted,
by authority of the government, amnesty to those
who would report to the nearest officer on duty
within twenty days, thus giving them the privilege
of reÃ«ntering the service in companies where they
would not be known.
</p>

<p>
"Let us," said the general, "oppose constancy
to adversity, fortitude to suffering, and courage to
danger, with the firm assurance that He who gave
freedom to our fathers will bless the efforts of their
children to preserve it."
</p>

<p>
Alas! few availed themselves of this solemn
appeal to their manhood.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile we received occasional letters from our
prisoner in Fort Lafayette. He was confined in a
casemate with about twenty men. A small grate
for burning coal sufficed for the preparation of their
rations, which were issued to them raw. They lay
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_323' name='Page_323' href='#Page_323'>323</a></span>
upon straw mats on the floor. Once daily they
could walk upon the ramparts, and my husband's
eyes turned sadly to the dim outlines of the beautiful
city where he had often been an honored guest.
The veil which hid from him so much of the grief
and struggle of the future hid also the reward.
Little did he dream he should administer justice on
the supreme bench of the mist-veiled city.
</p>

<p>
His letters bore but one theme, his earnest prayer
for exchange, so that he might do his part in our
defence.
</p>

<p>
One night all these things weighed more heavily
than usual upon me,â€”the picket firing, the famine,
the military executions, the dear one "sick and in
prison." I sighed audibly, and my son, Theodorick,
who slept near me, asked the cause, adding,
"Why can you not sleep, dear mother?"
</p>

<p>
"Suppose," I replied, "you repeat something for
me."
</p>

<p>
He at once commenced, "Tell me not in mournful
numbers"â€”and repeated the "Psalm of Life." I
did not sleep; those brave words were not strong
enough for the situation.
</p>

<p>
He paused, and presently his young voice broke
the stillness:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is
within me, bless His holy name"â€”going on to
the end of the beautiful psalm of adoration and faith
which nineteen centuries have decreed to be in very
truth a Psalm of Life.
</p>

<p>
I felt great responsibility in keeping with me my
sons, now ten and twelve years old. At a farmhouse
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_324' name='Page_324' href='#Page_324'>324</a></span>
about fifteen miles in the country a member of the
family was living, and availing myself of a passing
wagon, I sent the boys to share his plenty and comfort.
A few days afterwards they returnedâ€”a
dusty, footsore pair of urchins. They had run
away and come home! Moreover, they had found
an old horse left on the roadside to die,â€”which
Roger refused to leave,â€”had shared their luncheon
with him, given him water, assisted him to his feet,
and by slow stages led him home!
</p>

<p>
"Oh! <i>how</i> shall we feed him?" I exclaimed, in
despair.
</p>

<p>
"I'll help," said Captain Lindsay; "he shall be
immediately introduced to my mare, and she shall
share her oats with him;" and a very sober-minded,
steady horse he proved to be, quite good enough
to be stolen, as he finally was, by the enemy.
</p>

<p>
My friend, General Wilcox, put my own friendship
to a severe test one morning. Standing by the
mantel in his accustomed attitude, he informed me
that he had received many kind attentions from the
ladies of Petersburg (I was aware of an affair of the
heart in which a pretty widow was concerned), and
he proposed to give a <i><span lang="fr_FR">dÃ©jeuner Ã  la fourchette</span></i>, and
invite them out to his tent. Would I chaperon
the occasion, and might my parlor be used as a
reception room?
</p>

<p>
"Of course, General!" I replied. "They will
be welcome to me, and to the parlor. The '<i><span lang="fr_FR">fourchette</span></i>'
will be forthcoming without fail, but where,
oh, where can we find the '<i><span lang="fr_FR">dÃ©jeuner</span></i>'?"
</p>

<p>
"I have thought of all that," said the General.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_325' name='Page_325' href='#Page_325'>325</a></span>
"I will send half a dozen fellows out with guns
to bring in birds. I'll get John to make some cakes
and biscuits, we'll brew a bowl of punch. <i><span lang="fr_FR">VoilÃ !</span></i>
What more do you want?"
</p>

<p>
"That will be fine," I assured him, and accordingly
his invitations were sent, handsomely written,
to about thirty people. A load of evergreens was
delivered at the tent, and all hands set to work to
weave garlands. Every candle in camp was
"pressed." John made a fine success of his sponge
cakes, and also fruit and nut cakeâ€”the fruit, disguised
dried apples, the nuts, walnuts.
</p>

<p>
The day before the event the General leaned, a
dejected figure, against the mantel.
</p>

<p>
"Thoseâ€”blamedâ€”soldiers have returned. They
didn't bag a bird."
</p>

<p>
"I feared that! Virginia partridges are hunted
with dogs. Besides, where can you find game within
twenty miles of an army?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it will take six months' pay, but we must
buy oysters. I don't know what else we can do."
</p>

<p>
"General," I said, "suppose you have a breakfast
like one Mrs. â€”â€”, from North Carolina, gave
here when she stayed with me last month. She had
little <i><span lang="fr_FR">mÃ©nus</span></i> neatly written, including various dishes.
The dishes, however, were imaginary. They did
not appear! The guests left with the impression
that these things had been provided, but that accidents
which were to be counted on in time of war
had spoiled them. Now, John could easily announce
a fall of soot from the chimney,â€”like
Caleb Balderstone! Aunt Jinny would make an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_326' name='Page_326' href='#Page_326'>326</a></span>
admirable 'Mysie.' Have you never heard her
'skirl'? We might imagine partridges, turkey, and
ham, and then imagine the accidents. What could
be simpler?"
</p>

<p>
The General's breakfast was a great success. The
weather was fine. One of his staff, who was not
invited, confided to me his fear that there would be
nothing left! And, indeed, the guests brought noble
appetites. The General took in the pretty widow.
General A. P. Hill honored me. A gay procession
of open wagons filled with merry guests left the door
at sunset, and sang "The Bonnie Blue Flag" as they
wended their way home. General Lee from his headquarters
could hear the song, and doubtless it cheered
his sympathetic heart, albeit he knew a battle was near
at hand. He could not know that in that battle
General Hill and Colonel Pegram would fall with
all their wounds in front, among the first of those
martyrs whose lives were sacrificed after the leaders
<i>knew</i> there was no more life in the cause for which
they died.
</p>

<p>
Our friends in town sent many invitations to us
dwellers in tents. Of course, I accepted none of
them. I had no heart for gayety, and not one
moment's time to spare from my sewing. It is
passing strangeâ€”this disposition to revel in times
of danger and suffering. Florence was never so gay
as during the Plague! The men of our army who
had been absent three years were now near their
homes, and they abandoned themselves to the opportunities
of the hour. Some of them were engaged
to the beautiful young women of Petersburg.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_327' name='Page_327' href='#Page_327'>327</a></span>
"This is no time for marriage," said General Lee,
"no time while the country is in such peril;" and
yet he granted a furlough now and then to some
soldier who was unwilling to wait.
</p>

<p>
There were parties, "starvation parties," as they
were called on account of the absence of refreshments
impossible to be obtained. Not even the lump of
sugar allowed by Lady Morgan at her <i><span lang="it_IT">conversazione</span>s</i>
was possible here; but notwithstanding this serious
disadvantage, ball followed ball in quick succession.
"The soldier danced with the lady of his love at
night, and on the morrow danced the dance of death
in the deadly trench on the line." There the ranks
closed up; and in the ball room they closed up
also. There was always a comrade left for the partner
of the belle; and not one whit less valiant was
the soldier for his brief respite. He could go from
the dance to his place in the trenches with a light
jest, however heavy his heart might be. And when
the beloved commander ordered him forth, he could
step out with martial tread and cheer and songâ€”to
the march or into battle. I think all who remember
the dark days of the winter of 1864-1865 will bear
witness to the unwritten law enforcing cheerfulness.
It was tacitly understood that we must make no
moan, yield to no outward expression of despondency
or despair.
</p>

<p>
On January 30 General Wilcox came in, bringing
great news. Three commissioners authorized to
meet representatives of the Federal government
had arrived in Petersburg <i><span lang="fr_FR">en route</span></i> for Fortress
Monroe. They were Vice-President Stephens,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_328' name='Page_328' href='#Page_328'>328</a></span>
Senator R. M. T. Hunter, and James A. Campbell,
former Assistant Justice of the Supreme Court of
the United States, and now Assistant Secretary of
War of the Confederate States.
</p>

<p>
"I thought," said the General, "you might
come out and listen to the cheering. It is echoed
by the enemy. There seems to be no doubt of the
feeling on both sides."
</p>

<p>
I begged the General to lend me an ambulance,
and drove out to the front. The troops of Fort
Gregg and Battery 45â€”just in the rear of my gardenâ€”had
come out and were cheering vociferously.
There seemed to be a truce for the moment. We
could distinctly hear the answering cheers from the
opposing fortifications.
</p>

<p>
My ambulance drew up to the side of the road,
and presently an open carriage appeared, with the
mayor and the three commissioners. They paused
for a few minutes before crossing the line. With
my heart beating painfully, I left my ambulance and
walked to the carriage. There Mr. Hunter greeted
me kindly and introduced me to his companions.
Trembling with emotion, I said:â€”
</p>

<p>
"My errand is to you, dear Mr. Hunter. You
are going to see President Lincoln or his representative.
I entreat you, I implore you, to remember
your friend General Pryor. He is breaking his
heart in prison. Beg his release from Mr.
Lincoln."
</p>

<p>
"I willâ€”we will," they promised. The carriage
proceeded, and as it crossed the line a mighty cheer
went up from the hundreds of soldiers, Confederate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_329' name='Page_329' href='#Page_329'>329</a></span>
and Union, who were standing on duty and looking
on.
</p>

<p>
In an instant we were enemies again, and I was
hastening out of the range of shot and shell.
</p>

<p>
On February 5 the commissioners returned from
their bootless errand. Mr. Hunter wrote me that
they had "remembered Pryor as was promised, but
his release would not be considered."
</p>

<p>
An extract from Order No. 2, February 11, 1865,
from General Lee, explains the manner in which our
proposals had been received:â€”
</p>

<p>
"The choice between war and abject submission
is before us.
</p>

<p>
"To such a proposal, brave men, with arms in
their hands, can have but one answer.
</p>

<p>
"They cannot barter manhood for peace, nor the
right of self-government for life or property.
</p>

<p>
"Taking new resolution from the fate which our
enemies intend for us, let every man devote all his
energies to the common defence."
</p>

<p>
I am afraid we were too faint from want of food
to be as courageous as our noble commander
expected. Flour was now selling for $1500 a barrel;
bacon, $20 a pound; beef, $15 ditto: butter
could be had at $20 a pound. One chicken could
be bought for $50. Shad sold for $50 a pair
(before the war the price was not more than ten or
fifteen cents). One hundred dollars was asked for
one dollar in gold, making the price I had given
to save John from a negro trader $10,600!â€”news
which he heard with such concern that I hastened
to tell him I had never regretted it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_330' name='Page_330' href='#Page_330'>330</a></span>
</p>

<p>
John bethought himself of the fishes in the pond
and streams, but not a fish-hook was for sale in
Richmond or Petersburg. He contrived, out of a
cunning arrangement of pins, to make hooks, and
sallied forth with my boys. But the water was too
cold, or the fish had been driven down-stream by
the firing. The usual resource of the sportsman
with an empty creelâ€”a visit to the fishmongerâ€”was
quite out of the question. There was no fishmonger
any more.
</p>

<p>
Under these circumstances you may imagine my
sensations at receiving the following note:â€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"<span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Pryor</span>: General Lee has been honored
by a visit from the Hon. Thomas Connolly, Irish
M.P. from Donegal.
</p>

<p>
"He ventures to request you will have the kindness to
give Mr. Connolly a room in your cottage, if this can be
done without inconvenience to yourself."
</p>
</div> <!-- /blockquot -->

<p>
Certainly I could give Mr. Connolly a room;
but just as certainly I could not feed him! The
messenger who brought the note hastily reassured
me. He had been instructed to say that Mr. Connolly
would mess with General Lee. I turned Mr.
Connolly's room over to John, who soon became
devoted to his service. The M.P. proved a most
agreeable guest, a fine-looking Irish gentleman with
an irresistibly humorous, cheery fund of talk. He
often dropped in at our biscuit toasting, and assured
us that we were better provided than the
commander-in-chief.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_331' name='Page_331' href='#Page_331'>331</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"You should have seen 'Uncle Robert's' dinner
to-day, Madam! He had two biscuits, and he
gave me one."
</p>

<p>
Another time Mr. Connolly was in high feather.
</p>

<p>
"We had a glorious dinner to-day! Somebody
sent 'Uncle Robert' a box of sardines."
</p>

<p>
General Lee, however, was not forgotten. On
fine mornings quite a procession of little negroes, in
every phase of raggedness, used to pass my door,
each one bearing a present from the farmers' wives
of buttermilk in a tin pail, for General Lee. The
army was threatened with scurvy, and buttermilk,
hominy, and every vegetable that could be obtained
was sent to the hospital.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Connolly interested himself in my boys'
Latin studies.
</p>

<p>
"I am going home," he said, "and tell the English
women what I have seen here: two boys reading
CÃ¦sar while the shells are thundering, and their
mother looking on without fear."
</p>

<p>
"I am too busy keeping the wolf from my door,"
I told him, "to concern myself with the thunderbolts."
</p>

<p>
The wolf was no longer at the door! He had
entered and had taken up his abode at the fireside.
Besides what I could earn with my needle, I had
only my father's army ration to rely upon. My
faithful John foraged right and left, and I had
reason to doubt the wisdom of inquiring too closely
as to the source of an occasional half-dozen eggs or
small bag of corn. This last he would pound on a
wooden block for hominy. Meal was no longer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_332' name='Page_332' href='#Page_332'>332</a></span>
procurable. As I have said, we might occasionally
purchase for five dollars the head of a bullock from
the commissary, every other part of the animal
being available for army rations. By self-denial on
our own part, we fondly hoped we could support
our army and at last win our cause. We were not,
at the time, fully aware of the true state of things.
Our men were so depleted from starvation that the
most trifling wound would end fatally. Gangrene
would supervene, and then nothing could be done to
prevent death. Long before this time, at Vicksburg,
Admiral Porter found that many a dead soldier's
haversack yielded nothing but a handful of parched
corn. <i>We</i> were now enduring a sterner siege.
</p>

<p>
Before daylight, on the 2d of March, General Lee
sent for General Gordon, who was with his command
at a distant part of the line.<a name='FA_22' id='FA_22' href='#FN_22' class='fnanchor'>[22]</a> Upon arriving, General
Gordon was much affected by seeing General Lee
standing at the mantel in his room, his head bowed
on his folded arms. The room was dimly lighted
by a single lamp, and a smouldering fire was dying
on the hearth. The night was cold and General
Lee's room chill and cheerless.
</p>

<p>
"I have sent for you, General Gordon," said
General Lee, with a dejected voice and manner, "to
make known to you the condition of our affairs and
consult with you as to what we had best do. I have
here reports sent in from my officers to-night. I
find I have under my command, of all arms, hardly
forty-five thousand men. These men are starving.
They are already so weakened as to be hardly efficient.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_333' name='Page_333' href='#Page_333'>333</a></span>
Many of them have become desperate, reckless,
and disorderly as they have never been before.
It is difficult to control men who are suffering for
food. They are breaking open mills, barns, and
stores in search of it. Almost crazed from hunger,
they are deserting in large numbers and going home.
My horses are in equally bad condition. The supply
of horses in the country is exhausted. It has come
to be just as bad for me to have a horse killed as a
man. I cannot remount a cavalryman whose horse
dies. General Grant can mount ten thousand men
in ten days and move around your flank. If he
were to send me word to-morrow that I might move
out unmolested, I have not enough horses to move
my artillery. He is not likely to send me any such
message, although he sent me word yesterday that
he knew what I had for breakfast every morning.
I sent him word I did not think that this could be
so, for if he did he would surely send me something
better.
</p>

<p>
"But now let us look at the figures. As I said,
I have forty-five thousand starving men. Hancock
has eighteen thousand at Winchester. To oppose
him I have not a single vidette. Sheridan, with his
terrible cavalry, has marched unmolested and unopposed
along the James, cutting the railroads and the
canal. Thomas is coming from Knoxville with thirty
thousand well-equipped troops, and I have, to oppose
him, not more than three thousand in all. Sherman
is in North Carolina with sixty-five thousand men....
So I have forty-five thousand poor fellows in
bad condition opposed to one hundred and sixty
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_334' name='Page_334' href='#Page_334'>334</a></span>
thousand strong and confident men. These forces,
added to General Grant's, make over a quarter of a
million. To prevent them all from uniting to my
destruction, and adding Johnston's and Beauregard's
men, I can oppose only sixty thousand men. They
are growing weaker every day. Their sufferings are
terrible and exhausting. My horses are broken
down and impotent. General Grant may press around
our flank any day and cut off our supplies."
</p>

<p>
As a result of this conference General Lee went
to Richmond to make one more effort to induce our
government to treat for peace. It was on his return
from an utterly fruitless errand that he said:â€”
</p>

<p>
"I am a soldier! It is my duty to obey orders;"
and the final disastrous battles were fought.
</p>

<p>
It touches me to know now that it was after this
that my beloved commander found heart to turn
aside and bring me comfort. No one knew better
than he all I had endeavored and endured, and
my heart blesses his memory for its own sake. At
this tremendous moment, when he had returned
from his fruitless mission to Richmond, when the
attack on Fort Steadman was impending, when his
slender line was confronted by Grant's ever increasing
host, stretching twenty miles, when the men
were so starved, so emaciated, that the smallest wound
meant death, when his own personal privations were
beyond imagination, General Lee could spend half
an hour for my consolation and encouragement.
</p>

<p>
Cottage Farm being on the road between headquarters
and Fort Greggâ€”the fortification which
held General Grant in check at that pointâ€”I saw
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_335' name='Page_335' href='#Page_335'>335</a></span>
General Lee almost daily going to this work, or to
"Battery 45." On Sundays he regularly passed
on his famous horse, Traveller, on his way to a
little wooden chapel, going often through sleet and
rain, bending his head to shield his face from the
storm.
</p>

<p>
I was, as was my custom, sewing in my little
parlor one morning, about the middle of March,
when an orderly entered, saying:â€”
</p>

<p>
"General Lee wishes to make his respects to
Mrs. Pryor." The General was immediately
behind him. His face was lighted with the anticipation
of telling me his good news. With the
high-bred courtesy and kindness which always distinguished
his manner, he asked kindly after my
welfare, and, taking my little girl in his arms, began
gently to break his news to me:â€”
</p>

<p>
"How long, Madam, was General Pryor with me
before he had a furlough?"
</p>

<p>
"He never had one, I think," I answered.
</p>

<p>
"Well, did I not take good care of him until we
camped here so close to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," I said, puzzled to know the drift of
these preliminaries.
</p>

<p>
"I sent him home to you, I remember," he continued,
"for a day or two, and you let the Yankees
catch him. Now he is coming back to be with you
again on parole until he is exchanged. You must
take better care of him in future."
</p>

<p>
I was too much overcome to do more than stammer
a few words of thanks.
</p>

<p>
Presently he added, "What are you going to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_336' name='Page_336' href='#Page_336'>336</a></span>
say when I tell the General that in all this winter
you have never once been to see me?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, General Lee," I answered, "I had too much
mercy to join in your buttermilk persecution!"
</p>

<p>
"Persecution!" he said; "such things keep us
alive! Last night, when I reached my headquarters,
I found a card on my table with a hyacinth
pinned to it, and these words: 'for General Lee,
with a kiss!' Now," he added, tapping his breast,
"I have here my hyacinth and my cardâ€”<i>and I
mean to find my kiss</i>!"
</p>

<p>
He was amused by the earnest eyes of my little
girl, as she gazed into his face.
</p>

<p>
"They have a wonderful liking for soldiers," he
said. "I knew one little girl to give up all her
pretty curls willingly, that she might look like Custis!
'They <i>might</i> cut my hair like Custis's,' she said.
Custis! whose shaven head does not improve him
in any eyes but hers."
</p>

<p>
His manner was the perfection of repose and simplicity.
As he talked with me I remembered that
I had heard of this singular calmness. Even at
Gettysburg, and at the explosion of the crater, he
had evinced no agitation or dismay. I did not
know then, as I do now, that nothing had ever
approached the anguish of this moment, when he
had come to say an encouraging and cheering word
to me, after abandoning all hope of the success of
the cause.
</p>

<p>
After talking awhile and sending a kind message
to my husband, to greet him on his return, he rose,
walked to the window, and looked over the fieldsâ€”the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_337' name='Page_337' href='#Page_337'>337</a></span>
fields through which, not many days afterward, he
dug his last trenches!
</p>

<p>
I was moved to say, "You only, General, can tell
me if it is worth my while to put the ploughshare
into those fields."
</p>

<p>
"Plant your seeds, Madam," he replied; sadly
adding, after a moment, "the doing it will be some
reward."
</p>

<p>
I was answered. I thought then he had little
hope. I now know he had none.
</p>

<p>
He had already, as we have seen, remonstrated
against further resistanceâ€”against the useless shedding
of blood. His protest had been unheeded.
It remained for him now to gather his forces for
endurance to the end.
</p>

<p>
Twenty days afterward his headquarters were in
ashes; he had led his famished army across the
Appomattox; and, telling them they had done their
duty, and had nothing to regret, he had bidden
them farewell forever.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXII
<br />
<span class="s05">THE EVACUATION OF PETERSBURG</span>
</h2>

<p>
The happy day was not distant when the husband
and father of our little family was to be
restored to his own home and his own people.
</p>

<p>
I never inquired the source from which John
drew his materials for a festival; but, a day or two
before my husband was to arrive, he appeared with
a small duck! This he roasted to perfection, to be
served cold, as the hour for the dinner could not be
determined in advance.
</p>

<p>
We were all expectation and excitement when a
lady drove up rapidly and asked for shelter, as she
had been "driven in from the lines." Shelter I
could give by spreading quilts on the parlor floorâ€”but,
alas, my duck! Must my precious duck be
sacrificed upon the altar of hospitality? I unlocked
the little tin safe to assure myself that I could manage
to keep it hidden, and behold, it was gone!
Not until next day, when it was placed before my
husband with a triumphant flourish (our unwelcome
guest had departed), did I discover that John had
stolen it! "Why, there's the duck!" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Course here's the duck," said John, respectfully.
"Ducks got plenty of sense. They knows as well
as folks when to hide."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_339' name='Page_339' href='#Page_339'>339</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We found our released prisoner pale and thin,
but devoutly thankful to be at home. Mr. Connolly
and the officers around us called in the evening,
keenly anxious to hear his story, and heartily
expressing their joy at his release. My friends in
Washington had wished to send me some presents,
but my husband declined them, accepting only two
cans of pineapple. Mr. Connolly sent out for the
"boys in the yard" and assisted me in dividing the
fruit into portions, so each one should have a bit. It
was served on all the saucers and butter-plates we
could find, and Mr. Connolly himself handed the tray
around, exclaiming, "Oh, lads! It is just the <i>best</i>
thing you ever tasted!" Then each soldier brought
forth his brier-root and gathered around the traveller
for his story. His story was a thrilling oneâ€”of his
capture, his incarceration, his comrades; finally, of the
unexpected result of the efforts of his ante-bellum
friends, Washington McLean and John W. Forney,
for his release. It was ascertained by these friends in
Washington that he was detained as hostage for the
safety of some Union officer whom the Confederate
government had threatened to put to death.
</p>

<p>
Mr. McLean and Colonel Forney first approached
General Grant. The General positively
refused to grant their request. Then Mr. McLean
visited Mr. Stanton. He found Mr. Stanton in
the library of his own home, with his daughter in
his arms, and the following conversation ensued:â€”
</p>

<p>
"This is a charming fireside picture, Mr. Secretary!
I warrant that little lady cares nothing for
war or the Secretary of War! She has her father,
and that fills all her ambition."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_340' name='Page_340' href='#Page_340'>340</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"You never said a truer word, did he, pet?"
pressing the curly head close to his bosom.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, Stanton, you will understand my
errand. There are curly heads down there in old
Virginia, weeping out their bright eyes for a father
loved just as this pretty baby loves you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes! Probably so," said Stanton.
</p>

<p>
"Nowâ€”there's Pryorâ€”"
</p>

<p>
But before another word could be said the Secretary
of War pushed the child from his knee and
thundered:â€”
</p>

<p>
"He shall be hanged! Damn him!"
</p>

<p>
But he had reckoned without his host when he
supposed that Washington McLean would not
appeal from that verdict. Armed with a letter of
introduction from Horace Greeley, Mr. McLean
visited Mr. Lincoln. The President remembered
General Pryor's uniformly generous treatment of
prisoners who had, at various times, fallen into his
custody, especially his capture at Manassas of
the whole camp of Federal wounded, surgeons
and ambulance corps, and his prompt parole of the
same. Mr. Lincoln listened attentively, and, after
ascertaining all the facts, issued an order directing
Colonel Burke, the commander at Fort Lafayette,
to "deliver Roger A. Pryor into the custody of
Washington McLean."
</p>

<p>
Armed with this order, Mr. McLean visited Fort
Lafayette, where he found his friend in close confinement
in the casemate with other prisoners.
</p>

<p>
At that time John Y. Beall, a Confederate officer,
was confined with General Pryor, under sentence of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_341' name='Page_341' href='#Page_341'>341</a></span>
death as a spy. Mr. McLean became interested in
his fate, and suggested that if General Pryor would
make a personal appeal in his behalf to President
Lincoln, his execution might probably be prevented.
To that end, Mr. McLean telegraphed a request to
Mr. Lincoln, that he accord General Pryor an interview,
to which a favorable response was promptly
returned. The next evening, General Pryor, with
Mr. McLean and Mr. Forney, called at the White
House, and was graciously received by the President.
General Pryor at once opened his intercession in behalf
of Captain Beall; but, although Mr. Lincoln
evinced the sincerest compassion for the young man,
and an extreme aversion to his death, he felt
constrained to yield to the assurance of General Dix,
in a telegram just received, that the execution was
indispensable to the security of the Northern citiesâ€”it
being believed, though erroneously, that Captain
Beall was implicated in the burning of the New
York hotels. Mr. Lincoln then turned the conversation
to the recent conference at Hampton Roads,
the miscarriage of which he deplored with the profoundest
sorrow. He said that had the Confederate
government agreed to the reÃ«stablishment of the
Union and the abolition of slavery, the people of
the South might have been compensated for the loss
of their negroes and would have been protected by a
universal amnesty, but that Mr. Jefferson Davis
made the recognition of the Confederacy a condition
<i><span lang="la">sine qua non</span></i> of any negotiations. Thus, he declared,
would Mr. Davis be responsible for every drop of
blood that should be shed in the further prosecution
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_342' name='Page_342' href='#Page_342'>342</a></span>
of the war, a futile and wicked effusion of blood,
since it was then obvious to every sane man that the
Southern armies must be speedily crushed. On
this topic he dwelt so warmly and at such length
that General Pryor inferred that he still hoped the
people of the South would reverse Mr. Davis's
action, and would renew the negotiations for peace.
Indeed, he declared in terms that he could not believe
the senseless obstinacy of Mr. Davis represented
the sentiment of the South. It was apparent
to General Pryor that Mr. Lincoln desired him to
sound leading men of the South on the subject.
Accordingly, on the General's return to Richmond,
he did consult with Senator Hunter and other
prominent men in the Confederacy, but with one
voice they assured him that nothing could be done
with Mr. Davis, and that the South had only to wait
the imminent and inevitable catastrophe.
</p>

<p>
The inevitable catastrophe marched on apace.
</p>

<p>
Agnes wrote from Richmond, March 28â€”the
last letter I received from the Confederate capital:â€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I do hate to write you bad news just now when you
should be so happy with our dear General, but, really and
truly, I don't at all like the looks of things here. Sheridan
is at Ashland. And General Sherman has finished up
North Carolina, and is in Virginia!
</p>

<p>
"I made an excursion through some of the Main Street
stores last weekâ€”and recognized some of Mrs. Davis's
things. I learned that she had placed a great many
articles at the dry-goods stores for sale and had sold her
horses. And now comes the surprising news, that she has
left the city with her family. What does all this mean?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_343' name='Page_343' href='#Page_343'>343</a></span>
Some of the girls here have taken their jewellery to the
Treasury Department, giving it to help redeem the currency.
I am sure they are welcome to all mine!"
</p>
</div> <!-- /blockquot -->

<p>
On the morning of April 2 we were all up
early that we might prepare and send to Dr. Claiborne's
Hospital certain things we had suddenly
acquired. An old farmer friend of my husband had
loaded a wagon with peas, potatoes, dried fruit,
hominy, and a little bacon, and had sent it as a welcoming
present. We had been told of the prevalence
of scurvy in the hospitals, and had boiled a
quantity of hominy, and also of dried fruit, to be
sent with the potatoes for the relief of the sick.
</p>

<p>
My husband said to me at our early breakfast:â€”
</p>

<p>
"How soundly you can sleep! The cannonading
was awful last night. It shook the house."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that is only Fort Gregg," I answered.
"Those guns fire incessantly. I don't consider
them. You've been shut up in a casemate so
long you've forgotten the smell of powder."
</p>

<p>
Our father, who happened to be with us that
morning, said:â€”
</p>

<p>
"By the bye, Roger, I went to see General Lee,
and told him you seemed to be under the impression
that if your division moves, you should go along
with it. The General said emphatically: 'That
would be violation of his parole, Doctor. Your son
surely knows he cannot march with the army until
he is exchanged.'"
</p>

<p>
This was a great relief to me, for I had been
afraid of a different construction.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_344' name='Page_344' href='#Page_344'>344</a></span>
</p>

<p>
After breakfast I repaired to the kitchen to see
the pails filled for the hospital, and to send Alick and
John on their errand.
</p>

<p>
Presently a message was brought me that I must
join my husband, who had walked out to the fortification
behind the garden. I found a low earthwork
had been thrown up during the night still
nearer our house, and on it he was standing.
</p>

<p>
I have had, very lately, access to a Federal map
of the intrenched lines in the immediate front of
Petersburg, drawn by a major of engineers of the
United States Army. There I find a double line
of breastworks, protected by thirty-four forts sweeping
around the city and embracing some six or eight
miles of country beyond, on either side. Within the
Federal line is a little thread of a line protected by
lunettes and only <i>two</i> forts (for this map has quite a
Chinese feeling), and these two are named by the
enemy, Fort Gregg and Fort Baldwinâ€”the latter
our Battery 45. To my surprise I find the engineer
had his eye on me all winter. Near together are
certain dotsâ€”two for "Turnbull" (General Lee's
headquarters), two for "Green," two for "Laighton,"
and four for "Pryor," representing the dwelling,
office, kitchen, and servants' quarter at Cottage Farm!
I perceive from the map that the engineer knew all
about us all the time.
</p>

<p>
To return to the morning of April 2â€”my
husband held out his hand and drew me up on the
breastwork beside him. Negroes were passing,
wheeling their barrows, containing the spades they
had just used. Below was a plain, and ambulances
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_345' name='Page_345' href='#Page_345'>345</a></span>
were collecting and stopping at intervals. Then a
slender gray line stretched across under cover of the
first earthwork and the forts. Fort Gregg and
Battery 45 were belching away with all their
might, answered by guns all along the line. While
we gazed on all this the wood opposite seemed alive,
and out stepped a division of bluecoatsâ€”muskets
shining and banners flying in the morning sun. My
husband exclaimed: "My God! What a line!
They are going to fight here right away. Run
home and get the children in the cellar."
</p>

<p>
When I reached the little encampment behind the
house, I found the greatest confusion. Tents were
struck and a wagon was loading with them. Captain
Glover rode up to me and conjured me to leave
immediately. I reminded him of his promise not
to allow me to be surprised.
</p>

<p>
"We are ourselves surprised," he said; "believe
me, your life is not safe here a moment." Tapping
his breast, he continued, "I bear despatches proving
what I say."
</p>

<p>
I ran into the house and gathered my little children.
I bade the servants remain. If things grew
warm, they had the cellar, and perhaps their presence
would save their own goods and mine, should the
day go against us. Uncle Frank immediately
repaired to the cellar. "I have only one order," I
told the rest, "hide the General's flag." As I left
(bareheaded, I could not find my hat), I heard
Uncle Frank call from the little portholes of his
retreat to his wife, "For Gawd's sake, Jinny, bring
me a gode of water."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_346' name='Page_346' href='#Page_346'>346</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The morning was close and warm, and as we
toiled up the dusty road I regretted the loss of my
hat. Presently I met a gentleman driving rapidly
from town. It was my neighbor, Mr. Laighton.
He had removed his wife and little girls to a place
of safety and was returning for me. He proposed,
as we were now out of musket range, that I should
rest with the children under the shade of a tree, and
he would return to the farm to see if he could save
somethingâ€”what did I suggest? I asked that he
would bring a change of clothing for the children and
my medicine chest.
</p>

<p>
As we waited for his return some terrified horses
dashed up the road, one with blood flowing from
his nostrils. When Mr. Laighton finally returned,
he brought news that he had seen my husband, that
all the cooked provisions were spread out for the
passing soldiers, and that more were in preparation;
also that he had promised to take care of me, and
to leave the General free to dispense these things
judiciously. John had put the service of silver
into the buggy, and Eliza had packed a trunk,
for which he was to return. This proved to be
the French trunk in which Eliza sent a change of
clothing.
</p>

<p>
We were all soon in the buggy and on our way
to town.
</p>

<p>
"Where shall I take you?" asked Mr. Laighton.
I had no answer ready. I thought I would trust
to chance for an invitation. But we found the
streets full of refugees like ourselves, and like ourselves,
uncertain of shelter. Very few of our friends
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_347' name='Page_347' href='#Page_347'>347</a></span>
had remained in the city after the siege had proven
to be a permanent one.
</p>

<p>
After a while, as we drove slowly through the
crowded streets, we met Mr. Stuart, my husband's
tailor. He said a good house had been left vacant
by one of his customers, who had authorized him to
rent it.
</p>

<p>
"I now rent it to General Pryor," said Mr. Stuart,
and he conducted us to the door of a residence near
my old home on Washington Street. When the
door-bell was answered he informed a man whom
he addressed as Robert, that we had become his
master's tenants, and said that Robert and his
mother, now in the house, would not be required
to leave, adding:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Take good care of this lady. I will see that
your wages are paid and that you are suitably
rewarded."
</p>

<p>
The silver service was dumped down in the front
porch, and there we awaited events. About noon
John appeared. He had saved something!â€”my
champagne glasses! He had also brought a basket
of biscuits. I sent him back to the farm, strictly
ordering that the flag should be cared for. John
told me it was safe. He had hidden it under some
fence rails in the cellar. As to the battle, he had no
news, except that "Marse Roger is giving away
everything on the earth. All the presents from the
farmer will go in a little while."
</p>

<p>
My next envoy from the seat of war was Alick,
who walked into the yard, leading Rose by a rope,
and at once proceeded to stable her. Go back?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_348' name='Page_348' href='#Page_348'>348</a></span>
No, <i>marm</i>, not if he knew his name was Alick.
His mammy had never borned him to be in no battle!
And walking off to give Rose a pail of water, he
informed her that "You'n me, Rose, is the only
folks I see anywhar 'bout here with any sense."
</p>

<p>
Neighbors soon discovered us; and to my joy
I found that Mrs. Gibson, Mrs. Meade, and Mr.
Bishopâ€”one of my father's eldersâ€”were in their
own houses, very near my temporary shelter.
</p>

<p>
Our father, I learned afterwards, was with the
hospital service of his corps, and had been sent to
the rear.
</p>

<p>
The hospitals under Dr. Claiborne were ordered
off early in the day, a significant indication of
General Lee's accurate estimate of the probabilities
of the hour. Dr. Claiborne had three thousand
sick and wounded men to move. Among them
was Colonel Riddick, from Smithfield, the brother
of the spirited girl I had known there. She had
come to Petersburg to nurse her wounded brother,
and had left, in a wagon, with the hospital train.
Part of this train was captured, and the wagons were
ordered to be burned; but Miss Riddick positively
refused to leave her seat, and as they could
not burn the wagon with her in it, she was suffered
to proceed with her brother in her own equipage.
Miss Riddick was not a young lady who need fear.
"There's a divinity doth hedge" some women.
She was courteously treated and passed through
the lines to her friends.
</p>

<p class="caption hidepub"> <a href="images/i-380lg.jpg">View larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p>
In the evening the little boys came in with confidential
news. The day had gone against us;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_349' name='Page_349' href='#Page_349'>349</a></span>
the city was to be surrendered after the retreat of
the army at midnight. Their father would come
in with the last.
</p>

<p>
I remembered with anguish that I had lost my
chance to save the important papers of the family.
In a trunk in my room I had locked all my one
lover's beautiful letters, all the correspondenceâ€”so
rich I had meant to print itâ€”of his residence
in Greece, of his travels in the East and in Egypt;
all the letters from statesmen and authors of the
years preceding the struggle. There they were.
They would be sport for the enemy in a few hours.
My eldest son, Theodorick, and Campbell Pryor,
my husband's twelve-year-old brother, agreed to
return to the farm, draw the trunk out to the rear
of the kitchen, break it open, set fire to the contents,
and not leave until they were consumed.
</p>

<p>
In due time the boys returned, having accomplished
the burning of the letters, but bearing between them
a huge bundleâ€”a sheet full of papers. "Father's
sermons," explained Campbell.
</p>

<p>
When the time came for my tired little brood to
go to bed, I found three upper rooms prepared for
us. In one of these I put the boys, first placing the
large silver tray between two mattresses. A hamper
filled with soiled towels and pinafores stood in a
corner. Therein I bestowed the six pieces of the
service, covering the whole with the soiled linen.
A smaller room I reserved for my husband, into
which I locked him, putting the key in my pocketâ€”for
he had returned in such an excited frame of
mind, and in such physical exhaustion, that I was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_350' name='Page_350' href='#Page_350'>350</a></span>
uneasy about him, lest he might, when the army
passed, yield to his feelings and go along with it.
</p>

<p>
Then I took my seat at the window and listened.
The firing had all ceased.
</p>

<p>
A ring at the door-bell startled me. There stood
Mayor Townes, come to ask if General Pryor would
go out with the flag of truce and surrender the city.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he cannotâ€”he cannot," I declared. "How
can you ask him to surrender his old home? Besides,
he is worn out, and is now sleeping heavily."
</p>

<p>
About two o'clock, General Lee passed the house
with his staff. It is said he looked back and said to
his aide: "This is just what I told them at Richmond.
The line has been stretched until it snapped."
Presently there was a loud explosionâ€”anotherâ€”another.
The bridges were being blown up. Then
fires announced the burning of warehouses of tobacco.
</p>

<p>
And then! As the dawn broke, I saw the Federal
pickets entering silently, watchfully. Finding
no resistance, they threw their muskets over into
the yard and hurried down town to plunder!
</p>

<p>
I awoke my boys. "Get up, boys! Dress
quickly. Now remember, you must be very self-controlled
and quiet, and no harm will come to you."
</p>

<p>
Immediately the door of my room was thrown
wide open, and Robert ushered in three armed,
German-looking soldiers.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"To search the house," they answered.
</p>

<p>
"You will find nothing worth your while. There
is my shawl! I have just run in from the lines.
Here are my children."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_351' name='Page_351' href='#Page_351'>351</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"We don't want your clothes," said one; "we
want your prisoner."
</p>

<p>
My husband had heard and knocked at his door.
He had not undressed.
</p>

<p>
"Here I am," he said, coming out and fastening
his collar; and, before I could think, they had
marched him off.
</p>

<p>
I was left alone with the boy Robert, who had betrayed
him. He stood trembling, not with fearâ€”with
excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Leave this house!" I ordered him.
</p>

<p>
"What for?" he asked sullenly.
</p>

<p>
"Because you are no friend of mine. This is now
my house. You are not to set foot in it again."
</p>

<p>
Strange to say, he left.
</p>

<p>
He had admitted into the house more soldiers
than these three. I had brought with me from the
farm a little negress, Lizzie, who had been hired by
Eliza "to amuse the baby." Lizzie had obeyed
the instinct which always leads a child's Southern
nurse to the kitchen, and had gone below with my
baby. I heard the most tremendous stamping and
singing in the basement kitchen, and from the top
of the staircase I called to Lizzie, who ran up,
frightened, with the child in her arms. A soldier
looked up from the bottom.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing here?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Getting breakfast," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"You'll get none here," I told him.
</p>

<p>
He set his bayonet forward and started up the
steps. I slipped back and luckily found a bolt on
the door. Quick as thought I bolted him out.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_352' name='Page_352' href='#Page_352'>352</a></span>
</p>

<p>
But I was burningly indignant. I saw the street
full of troops standing, and a young officer on
horseback. I ran out and said to him:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Is it your pleasure we should be murdered in
our houses? My kitchen is full of soldiers."
</p>

<p>
"Where, where?" exclaimed the young fellow,
dismounting and running in.
</p>

<p>
I conducted him to the bolted door, unfastened
it, and had the satisfaction of seeing him lay about
with the flat of his sword to good purpose. He
placed a guard around the house. Moreover, his
action sustained me in my position, and the old
woman in the kitchen greeted me respectfully,
apologized for her son, and promised faithful service
in the future.
</p>

<p>
But another and most bitter trial was in store for
me. An approaching army corps was hailed with
shouts and cheers as it passed down the street. At
its head was borne the trophy that had aroused this
enthusiasm: our own sacred banner, given by
the women of Petersburg to the young colonel at
Smithfield, and inscribed with the names of the
battles into which he had proudly borne it. It was
coming backâ€”a captive! How grateful I felt that
my husband had not seen it! "Ole Uncle Frank's
at the bottom of that business," said Alick,â€”and
alas! we had reason to suppose the polite old colored
gentleman had purchased favor by revealing the
hiding-place of our banner. My husband soon
returned. He had presented Mr. Lincoln's card,
on which the President had written his "parole until
exchanged." Thereafter he was arrested and released
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_353' name='Page_353' href='#Page_353'>353</a></span>
every time the occupying troops moved and
were replaced by new brigades and divisions.
</p>

<p>
We sat all day in the front room, watching the
splendidly equipped host as it marched by on its
way to capture Lee. It soon became known that
we were there. Within the next few days we had
calls from old Washington friends. Among others
my husband was visited by Elihu B. Washburne,
and Senator Henry Wilson, afterward Vice-President
of the United States with General Grant. These
paid long visits and talked kindly and earnestly of
the South.
</p>

<p>
Major-General Warren had been relieved of his
command and superseded by Sheridan. His old
friend, Randolph Harrison, lay ill and wounded near
us, and General Warren introduced himself to
General Pryor and asked to be conducted to his
friend's bedside. From that time he was with us
every day, and, indorsed warmly by "Ranny," our
old friend, he too was admitted into our friendship.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Lincoln soon arrived and sent for my husband.
But General Pryor excused himself, saying
that he was a paroled prisoner, that General
Lee was still in the field, and that he could hold no
conference with the head of the opposing army.
</p>

<p>
The splendid troops passed continually. Our
hearts sank within us. We had but one hopeâ€”that
General Lee would join Joseph E. Johnston
and find his way to the mountains of Virginia, those
ramparts of nature which might afford protection
until we could rest and recruit.

CHAPTER XXIII
<br />
<span class="s05">RICHMOND SURRENDERS</span>
</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter_head">"<span class="smcap">Richmond</span>, April 5, 1865.
</p>

<p>
"<i>My dear:</i>â€”I am not at all sure you will ever
receive this letter, but I shall risk it. <i>First</i>, I
join you in humble thanks to God for the great
mercy accorded both of us. Your General lives. My
Colonel lives. What words can express our gratitude?
What is the loss of home and goods compared with the loss
of our own flesh and blood? Alas! Alas! for those who
have lost all!
</p>

<p>
"I am sure you will have heard the grewsome story of
Richmond's evacuation. I was at St. Paul's Sunday,
April 1, when a note was handed to President Davis.
He rose instantly, and walked down the aisleâ€”his face
set, so we could read nothing. Dr. Minnegerode gave
notice that General Ewell desired the forces to assemble
at 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and also that there would be no further service
that day. I had seen no one speak to the doctor, and I
wonder at the acuteness of his perception of the state of
affairs. As soon as I reached the hotel I wrote a note to
the proprietor, asking for news. He answered that grave
tidings had come from Petersburg, and for himself he was by
no means sure we could hold Richmond. He requested
me to keep quiet and not encourage a tendency to excitement
or panic. At first I thought I would read my services
in the quiet of my little sky parlor at the Spotswood,
but I was literally in a fever of anxiety. I descended to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_355' name='Page_355' href='#Page_355'>355</a></span>
the parlor. Nobody was there except two or three children
with their nurses. Later in the afternoon I walked
out and met Mr. James Lyons. He said there was no
use in further evading the truth. The lines were broken
at Petersburg and that town and Richmond would be
surrendered late at nightâ€”he was going out himself with
the mayor and Judge Meredith with a flag of truce and
surrender the city. Trains were already fired to carry
the archives and bank officials. The President and his
Cabinet would probably leave at the same time.
</p>

<p>
"'And you, Judge?'
</p>

<p>
"'I shall stand my ground. I have a sick family, and
we must take our chances together.'
</p>

<p>
"'Then seriouslyâ€”really and trulyâ€”Richmond is
to be given up, after all, to the enemy.'
</p>

<p>
"'Nothing less! And we are going to have a rough
time, I imagine.'
</p>

<p>
"I could not be satisfied until I had seen Judge Campbell,
upon whom we so much relied for good, calm sense.
I found him with his hands full of papers, which he waved
deprecatingly as I entered.
</p>

<p>
"'Just a minute, Judge! I am alone at the Spotswood
andâ€”'
</p>

<p>
"'Stay there, my dear lady! You will be perfectly
safe. I advise all families to remain in their own houses.
Keep quiet. I am glad to know the Colonel is safe. He
may be with you soon now.'
</p>

<p>
"With this advice I returned and mightily reassured
and comforted the proprietor of the Spotswood. He
immediately caused notice to be issued to his guests. I
resolved to convey my news to the families I knew best.
The Pegrams were in such deep affliction there was no
room there for anxious fears about such small matters as
the evacuation of cities, but I could see my dear Mrs.
Paul, and Mrs. Maben, and say a comforting word at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_356' name='Page_356' href='#Page_356'>356</a></span>
Allan homeâ€”closed to all the world since poor John fell
at Gettysburg. Mrs. Davis was gone and out of harm's
way. The Lees were sacred from intrusion. Four
members of that householdâ€”the General, 'Rooney,'
Custis, and Robertâ€”were all at the post of danger.
Late in the afternoon three hundred or more prisoners
were marched down the street; the negroes began
to stand about, quietly observant but courteous, making no
demonstration whatever. The day, you remember, was
one of those glorious days we have in April, and millions
on millions of stars watched at night, looking down on
the watchers below. I expected to sit by my window all
night as you always do in a troubled time, but sleep overtook
me. I had slept, but not undressed, when a loud
explosion shook the houseâ€”then another. There were
crashing sounds of falling glass from the concussion. I
found the sun had risen. All was commotion in the
streets, and agitation in the hotel. The city government
had dragged hogsheads of liquor from the shops,
knocked in the heads, and poured the spirits into the gutters.
They ran with brandy, whiskey, and rum, and
men, women, and boys rushed out with buckets, pails,
pitchers, and in the lower streets, hats and boots, to be
filled. Before eight o'clock many public buildings were
in flames, and a great conflagration was evidently imminent.
The flames swept up Main Street, where the
stores were quickly burned, and then roared down the
side streets almost to Franklin.
</p>

<p>
"The doors of all the government bakeries were thrown
open and food was given to all who asked it. Women
and children walked in and helped themselves. At ten
o'clock the enemy arrived,â€”ten thousand negro troops,
going on and on, cheered by the negroes on the streets.
</p>

<p>
"So the morning passedâ€”a morning of horror, of
terror! Drunken men shouted and reeled through the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_357' name='Page_357' href='#Page_357'>357</a></span>
streets, a black cloud from the burning city hung like a
pall over us, a black sea of faces filled the street below,
shells burst continuously in the ashes of the burning
armory. About four in the afternoon a salute of thirty-four
guns was fired. A company of mounted dragoons
advanced up the street, escorting an open carriage drawn
by four horses in which sat Mr. Lincoln and a naval
officer, followed by an escort of cavalry. They drove
straight to Mr. Davis's house, cheered all the way by
negroes, and returned the way they came. I had a good
look at Mr. Lincoln. He seemed tired and oldâ€”and
I must say, with due respect to the President of the United
States, I thought him the ugliest man I had ever seen.
He was fairly elected the first time, I acknowledge,â€”but
was he the last? A good many of the 'free and equal'
were not allowed a vote then.
</p>

<p>
"The next day I persuaded one of the lads in the hotel
to take a walk with me early in the morning, and I
passed General Lee's house. A Yankee guard was pacing
to and fro before itâ€”at which I felt an impulse of indignation,â€”but
presently the door opened, the guard took
his seat on the steps and proceeded to investigate the
contents of a very neatly furnished tray, which Mrs. Lee
in the kindness of her heart had sent out to him.
</p>

<p>
"I am obliged to acknowledge that there is really no hope
now of our ultimate success. Everybody says so. My heart
is too full for words. General Johnson says we may comfort
ourselves by the fact that war may decide a <i>policy</i>, but never
a <i>principle</i>. I imagine our <i>principle</i> is all that remains to us
of hope or comfort.
</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l8">"Devotedly,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Agnes</span>."
</p>
</div> <!-- /blockquot -->

<p>
From my friend Admiral Porter I learned that he
landed with President Lincoln, and that through
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_358' name='Page_358' href='#Page_358'>358</a></span>
some <i><span lang="fr_FR">contretemps</span></i> no equipage was in waiting to
conduct them through the streets of Richmond.
They set out to walk, escorted by twelve of the
boat's crew with bayonets fixed on their rifles. The
day was warm, and the streets dusty, "owing to
the immense gathering of the crowd, kicking up the
dirt." Mr. Lincoln took off his hat and fanned his
face, from which the perspiration was pouring, and
looked as if he would give his presidency for a glass
of water.
</p>

<p>
The admiral, <i><span lang="fr_FR">par parenthÃ¨se</span></i>, told many negro
anecdotes in negro dialect, but, like all Northern
imitators of that inimitable lingo, he "slipped up"
on many words. The negro does not say "Massa"â€”his
word is "Marster"; he does not say "<i>Bress</i>
de Lawd,"â€”"Thank Gawd A'mighty" being his
pious preference.
</p>

<p>
The triumphing party was overtaken by an equipage
and a military escort, and proceeded, according
to the admiral, "to the mansion of Mr. Davis.<a name='FA_23' id='FA_23' href='#FN_23' class='fnanchor'>[23]</a> It
was quite a small affair compared with the White
House, and modest in all its appointments, showing
that while President Davis was engaged heart and
soul in endeavoring to effect the division of the
states, he was not, at least, surrounding himself with
regal style, but was living in a modest, comfortable
way, like any other citizen. Amid all his surroundings
the refined taste of his wife was apparent, and
marked everything about the apartments." Admiral
Porter thought that the Confederate government
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_359' name='Page_359' href='#Page_359'>359</a></span>
had departed in an ignoble manner, "that it should
have remained at the capital and surrendered in a
dignified way, making terms for the citizens of the
place, guarding their rights, and acknowledging
they had lost the game. There was nothing to
be ashamed of in such a surrender to a vastly
superior force; their armies had fought as people
never fought before. They had 'robbed the cradle
and the grave' to sustain themselves, and all that
was wanted to make them glorious was the submission
of their leaders and troops in a dignified
way," etc.
</p>

<p>
This was also the feeling of many of our own
best menâ€”of General Lee and scores of his
officers, of Judge Campbell, of the private citizens
of Richmond. Mr. Davis differed from
these men. General Lee's opinion was known
to his officers. General Gordon once said to
him:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Have you expressed an opinion, as to the propriety
of making terms, to the President or to
Congress?"<a name='FA_24' id='FA_24' href='#FN_24' class='fnanchor'>[24]</a>
</p>

<p>
His reply was: "General Gordon, I am a soldier.
It is my duty to obey orders.... It is enough to
turn a man's hair gray to spend one day in that
Congress. The members are patriotic and earnest,
but they will neither take the responsibility of acting
nor will they clothe me with authority to act. As
for Mr. Davis, he is unwilling to do anything short
of independence, and feels that it is useless to try to
treat on that basis." This conversation immediately
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_360' name='Page_360' href='#Page_360'>360</a></span>
preceded the terrible battle at Petersburg, and the
consequent loss of that city and Richmond. Much
could have been saved in blood and in treasure had
the final battles never taken place. "Whom the
gods destroy they first infatuate."
</p>

<p class="p2">
Intelligence of the death of President Lincoln
reached Petersburg on the 17th of April. As he
had been with us but a few days before, manifestly
in perfect health and in all the glow and gladness of
the triumph of the Federal arms, the community
was unspeakably shocked by the catastrophe. That
he fell by the hand of an assassin, and that the deed
was done by a Confederate and avowedly in the
interest of the Confederate cause, were circumstances
which distressed us with an apprehension that the
entire South would be held responsible for the atrocious
occurrence. The day after the tragic news
reached us the people of Petersburg in public meeting
adopted resolutions deploring the President's
death and denouncing his assassination,â€”resolutions
which gave expression to the earnest and universal
sentiment of Virginia. I question if, in any quarter
of the country, the virtues of Abraham Lincolnâ€”as
exhibited in his spirit of forgiveness and forbearanceâ€”are
more revered than in the very section
which was the battle-ground of the fight for independence
of his rule. It is certainly our conviction
that had he lived the South would never have suffered
the shame and sorrow of the carpet-bag rÃ©gime.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXIV
<br />
<span class="s05">SHERIDAN'S OCCUPATION OF PETERSBURG</span>
</h2>

<p>
Such alarming rumors reached us from the
neighboring counties, of marauding parties
plundering private houses and frightening
defenceless women, that my husband obtained an
extension of his parole, and permission to visit his
sisters in Nottoway County. He had not heard
from his father since the fight at Cottage Farm.
Leaving me in the care of my neighbor, good Mr.
Bishop, he set forth.
</p>

<p>
The first stirring event of our new position was
the arrival of prisoners, marched through the streets
under a strong guard. They were a forlorn body
of ragged, hatless, barefoot men. They had found
poles or sticks somewhere, and upon them they
waved their hats and handkerchiefsâ€”the poor, brave
fellows! We women stood at the doors of our
houses with smiles and encouraging words. One
of the soldiers darted from the ranks, rushed to me,
<i>embraced me</i> as if I were a sister, and slipped his
watch into my hands! It was a novel experience;
but I think if he had appeared as a prisoner in the
garb of Beelzebub, horns, hoofs, and all, I should
not have flinched. Within the watch I found his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_362' name='Page_362' href='#Page_362'>362</a></span>
nameâ€”a connection of our family and a valued
friend. He had recognized me, but I could not
recognize the elegant young colonel in his impersonation
of a ragged barefoot boy.
</p>

<p>
My little sons soon found the destination of the
captives, also that citizens were getting permits from
headquarters to take them home.
</p>

<p>
"Then you must go and ask General Hartsuff
for a permit," I said. Upon inquiry it appeared
that this could not be done by proxy. Some adult
member of the family must apply in person.
</p>

<p>
So I took my young escorts with me, and we
went to "Centre Hill," the fine Bolling House,
where the General had made his headquarters. I
presented my plea. How many did I want? I
thought I could take care of eight. Their names?
I could give only one, the owner of the watch. The
General kindly conceded that I might select my men,
adding, "Would to God I could release them all!"
</p>

<p>
The first impression I had of the temporary
prison was of stifling heat in which no one could
live. The place smelt violently! My friend
helped me choose my men, and I was required to
present myself with them, armed with my order,
to have my name and theirs entered in an army
register, with an order that they report every day
until the command moved on. As I was leaving
the warehouse a fair-haired boy said to me, "Oh,
take me along too!"
</p>

<p>
"Take my arm," I said; and not until I
reached the street did I realize the enormity of
my mistake. I had stolen a prisoner!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_363' name='Page_363' href='#Page_363'>363</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I knew well I could be severely punished. My
boy soon told me his name. He was Frank
Brooke, nephew of our dear Judge Randolph
Tucker.
</p>

<p>
But here was a dilemma. All night I revolved
it in my mind. I had nine menâ€”eight were to
report next morning. Very early Alick knocked
at my door.
</p>

<p>
"What is it now, Alick?"
</p>

<p>
"One of dem prisoners run away las' night! I
hear de do' open and jump up to see what's de
matter. He say, 'Keep still, boy! Hit's all
right!'"
</p>

<p>
"So it is, Alick," I said, "it's perfectly delightful."
</p>

<p>
I took a piece of my husband's silver service
down to the Northern sutler, and pawned it for
two hundred dollars. With this money I purchased
shoes, handkerchiefs, and hats for my men,
and kept them in comfort for a week or more.
They were then "moved on" to other and distant
quarters,â€”and all very soon liberated.
</p>

<p>
One morning early I was summoned from my
room by Alick, who informed me that four gentlemen
had called. Descending to the parlor, I found
four officers in Federal uniform. As soon as I
entered, one of them asked brusquely:â€”
</p>

<p>
"How many rooms are in this house?"
</p>

<p>
"I think there are eight or ten."
</p>

<p>
"General Sheridan wants the house for his
adjutant's office."
</p>

<p>
I was aware that General Sheridan had arrived
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_364' name='Page_364' href='#Page_364'>364</a></span>
the day before, and had taken possession of Mr.
Hamilton's elegant mansion on the next street, in
the rear of my little dwelling.
</p>

<p>
I at once perceived that the General, although
in a house of twenty or more rooms, had not desired
the noise and inconvenience of an adjutant's
office under his own roof. I answered coldly:â€”
</p>

<p>
"I cannot oblige General Sheridan. My house
is small. I need it for my own family."
</p>

<p>
One of the officers rose, crossed the room, and,
standing before me, said sternly:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Madam, you seem to be unaware that when
General Sheridan sees a house that suits him, he
knows how to make the terms for it."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well," I replied, "I had forgotten that fact
for the moment. Do I understand my family
must go in the street? How much time can you
give me to remove them?"
</p>

<p>
The officers withdrew into the hall and conferred
together. Presently one of them returned,
and informed me courteously that they had concluded
not to annoy me. He was aware he was
addressing Mrs. General Pryor. His own name
was Captain Lee, and he had been happy to spare
me inconvenience.
</p>

<p>
The next morning I was awakened soon after
dawn by a tremendous hubbub below me, and
sending my little maid, Lizzie, to ascertain the
cause, she beckoned to me to come to the head of
the stairs. I threw on my gown, thrust my feet
into my carpet slippers, and peeped over the banister.
Captain Lee was standing at the foot of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_365' name='Page_365' href='#Page_365'>365</a></span>
the stair, writing a note on the top of the newel
post. Looking up, he saw me, and said: "I was
writing to you, Madam. General Sheridan has
ordered us to take your house. It is a military
necessity. I pray you will try to be patient, and
I will do all I can to save you annoyance."
</p>

<p>
"How soon must I leave?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all! We can allow you two roomsâ€”the
one you already occupy and the one below it."
</p>

<p>
I appreciated the concession of the latter room,
and busied myself to make of it dining room and
sitting room.
</p>

<p>
I brought beds from a rear room to my own
chamber, for the lodging of my family. Alick was
positively stricken at the new turn things had taken;
but I represented to him and to the boys the grave
necessity, in their father's absence, of discreet and
always courteous behavior.
</p>

<p>
To add to my embarrassment, John brought in
several hundred books he had picked up on the
farm. They were dumped down in a pile in the
corner of my reception room.
</p>

<p>
The weather was intensely hot. It was impossible
to sit with closed doors. I locked the doors
of my bedroom during the day, and all the family,
except myself, lived in the yard under my eyes,
unless the rain drove them within.
</p>

<p>
The first night of our captivity I had sent my
baby with her small nurse to bed. Hearing a heavy
step overhead, I ran up to my room. Standing in
an easy attitude, leaning on the mantel, was a large
negro man. He was smoking a cigar and talking
to Lizzie.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_366' name='Page_366' href='#Page_366'>366</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"What is your business here?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Only my pleasureâ€”to pass away a little time."
</p>

<p>
"Look at me!"
</p>

<p>
The negro raised his eyes with an insolent smile.
Slowly and with emphasis I said:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Do you leave this room instantly! And mark
well my words. If ever you enter it again, I shall
KILL you!"
</p>

<p>
He left, and alas, alas! my poor little Lizzie,
whom I had hired from her mother, left also; and
not by me or by her friends was she ever seen
again!
</p>

<p>
Only those who have lived in an adjutant's office
can know the ceaseless noise, turmoil, tramping to
and fro, loud talking night and day. There was
<i>no</i> night. The gas (which they left me to pay for)
burned brightly all night. Officers were coming in
for orders day and night. I never knew to what
use the upper rooms were put; I only know they
were rarely silent. All the business of a great army
was transacted here, that the General's entertaining,
his elegant life, his sleep, might be undisturbed.
</p>

<p>
The sentry was drawn so closely around my doors
that I could never enter the yard or garden without
passing them. Finally, upon going out to the little
vine-clad summer-house to give my baby airâ€”I
cannot say fresh airâ€”one of the sentinels shook my
equilibrium by informing me as I passed:â€”
</p>

<p>
"We've caught Jeff Davis."
</p>

<p>
When I returned, my eyes cast down to avoid
him, he stepped close to me and hissed in my ear,
"He shall be <i>hanged</i>."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_367' name='Page_367' href='#Page_367'>367</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Davis had not then been arrested, but this I
did not know. Leaving my baby with her brothers,
I walked straight into the veranda of Mr. Hamilton's
house, asked for General Sheridan, was ushered
into a room where a number of officers were sitting
around a table, and announced myself.
</p>

<p>
"I am Mrs. Pryor, whose house you have taken
for an adjutant's office. Sentinels have been placed
around my house who insult me when I cross the
threshold."
</p>

<p>
General Sheridan rose: "What can we do for
you, Madam? What do you demand?"
</p>

<p>
"That the sentry around my house be removed
to the street enclosure."
</p>

<p>
I was invited to take a seat, but I preferred standing
while an order was made out. I have often
smiled to think what I must have looked like to
those officers. My gown was of chocolate-colored
percale, with a white spot. Enormous hoops were
then in fashion. I had long since been abandoned
by mine. I fancy I resembled nothing so much as
the wooden Mrs. Noah who presides over the
animals in the children's "Noah's Arks." I took
the order given me, bowed my thanks, and walked
through a line of soldiers home. After this I had
the larger liberty my children needed.
</p>

<p>
It was my custom, in these days of my captivity,
to descend early, that I might guard my books, to
my little reception room. A dining room it did not
become for a long time afterward. I had nothing
whatever to eat except the biscuits brought me by
Mr. Bishop, and a daily tray sent at noon by my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_368' name='Page_368' href='#Page_368'>368</a></span>
angel friend, Mrs. Meade. She had some Northern
men boarding with her and could command such fare
as the sutler was willing to sell, for the farmers were
as destitute of fresh food as ourselves.
</p>

<p>
We had been excellent customers of a cigar shop
in old times, and the proprietor now opened his
establishment, and intrusted my boys and Campbell
with a "walking agency." They sold cigars at
good profit to the officers and soldiers around us;
and we made acquaintance once more with United
States pennies and dimes.
</p>

<p>
Sitting all day in my little reception room, I was
cheered by visits from my friends, and occasionally
the tenants of the house would ask for a glass of
water from the sideboard. Captain Lee came often.
He confided to me his chagrin at the manners of
the Petersburg ladies. He had picked up a veil for
a pretty girl, and she had turned away her head
when her hand was extended to receive it. The
Captain was deeply hurt: he was "a Northern man,
yes, but" he was "a gentleman."
</p>

<p>
One day Captain Lee informed me that he had
good news for me. "We have marching orders!
We go to-night! I know you are pleased! We
have given you so much trouble!"
</p>

<p>
"Not more, I suppose, than was necessary!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I must say, you have been very patient.
General Sheridan is in the office and wishes to make
his respects to you."
</p>

<p>
The General entered and thanked me for the manner
in which I had endured all the inconvenience to
which he had subjected me. He seemed, for some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_369' name='Page_369' href='#Page_369'>369</a></span>
reason, to wish me to think well of his course toward
us, and began to explain it. He alluded to the
policy that he had adopted.
</p>

<p>
"It was the very best thing to do," he declared.
"The only way to stamp out this rebellion was to
handle it without gloves."
</p>

<p>
If he fancied I would either argue or agree with
him, he mistook me. I was silent. There was an
embarrassing pause, and he began to berate our government
for bad management. "Ladies should be
better cared for," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Why, I assure you there was no necessity for
your starving! I have unearthed, within forty miles
of this place, enough provisions to keep you in
perfect comfort."
</p>

<p>
Looking down, he espied the brown eyes of my
baby steadfastly fastened on his face.
</p>

<p>
"I think I must borrow this little lady," he said.
"It is not often General Sheridan has anything in
his arms as sweet as this."
</p>

<p>
He still had her in his arms as he turned to leave
the room, and she gladly went with him. Presently
she was brought back with a parcel in her own armsâ€”figs,
bananas, cakes, and nuts.
</p>

<p>
Captain Lee came in late to bid me good-by,
and to reiterate his thanks.
</p>

<p>
"You really have been so very nice! Now I am
going to beg you will allow me to make some return."
</p>

<p>
I hastened to accept his offer. I told him that
my General's pet mare, Lady Jane, was in his command.
She had been missing ever since the battles
around Richmond. John was sure he had seen her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_370' name='Page_370' href='#Page_370'>370</a></span>
By some chance she had fallen into the hands of the
troops now in Petersburg. Could it be possible for
me to reclaim her?
</p>

<p>
The Captain looked grieved.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said; "I had no thought of anything
of that kind. But a great many ladies have asked
for what I am going to give you. I have brought
you General Sheridan's autograph."
</p>

<p>
He instantly interpreted my disappointment.
Before I could recover he added, "But it appears
you don't wish it," and threw it on the table.
</p>

<p>
"I can at least, Captain, be grateful that you tried
to please me."
</p>

<p>
That night the adjutant's office was closed. Next
morning my husband returned. General Warren
came in to see him. General Sheridan stood on
our porch to receive the homage of his men, bowing
to their cheers. General Warren looked on from
our window. Presently the troops he had commanded
when he was superseded by Sheridan passed
the house. They saw their old commander, and
the shouts, "Hurrah for General Warren," must
have been harsh sounds for General Sheridan.
</p>

<p>
I was alone one afternoon in my accustomed seat,
when a tall, lantern-jawed soldier with a musket on
his shoulder marched in.
</p>

<p>
"I want some whiskey!" he informed me.
</p>

<p>
"You'll not get it here!"
</p>

<p>
"Wall, I guess you'll have to scare it up. I'll
search the house.'
</p>

<p>
"Search away! I'll call the provost guard to
help you," I said.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_371' name='Page_371' href='#Page_371'>371</a></span>
</p>

<p>
He turned and marched out. At the door he
sent me a parting shot:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Wall! you've got a damned tongue ef you
ain't got no whiskey!"
</p>

<p>
My husband has always considered this a very
good story. I forestall him by telling it myself!
</p>

<p>
I grew very fond of General Warren. He spent
many hours with us; tactful, considerate, and kind,
he never grieved or offended us.
</p>

<p>
One evening he silently took his seat. Presently
he said:â€”
</p>

<p>
"I have news which will be painful to you. It
hurts me to tell you, but I think you had rather
hear it from me than from a strangerâ€”General
Lee has surrendered."
</p>

<p>
It was an awful blow to us. All was over. All
the suffering, bloodshed, deathâ€”all for nothing!
</p>

<p>
General Johnston's army was surrendered to
General Sherman in North Carolina on April 26.
The banner which had led the armies of the South
through fire and blood to victory, to defeat, in times
of starvation, cold, and friendlessness; the banner
that Helen's lover had waved aloft on a forlorn hope
until it fell from his lifeless hands; the banner found
under the dying boy at Gettysburg, who had smilingly
refused assistance lest it be discovered,â€”the
banner of a thousand histories was furled forever,
with none so poor to do it reverence.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXV
<br />
<span class="s05">WOE TO THE VANQUISHED!</span>
</h2>

<p>
Immediately after General Lee's surrender,
the United States Circuit Court held a
session at Norfolk, Virginia, and made haste
to indict for treason Robert E. Lee, John C. Breckenridge,
Roger A. Pryor, and others. These men
thereafter were not to feel any sense of personal
security. A cloud of doubt and possible disaster
still hung over them. Under this cloud they were
to commence their lives anew.
</p>

<p>
Every one who has suffered an overwhelming
misfortune must be conscious of a strange deadening
of feelingâ€”more intolerable even than pain. It
may be a merciful provision of nature. Insensibility
at a crucial moment may be nature's anÃ¦sthesia.
Dr. Livingstone, the African explorer, relates
that he was conscious of this insensibility when in
the paws of a lion. He had a theory that the
instinct of all animals to shake their victim, as
the cat does a mouse, may be given in mercy to the
vanquished. I was so completely stunned by the
thought that all the suffering, all the spilt blood,
all the poverty, all the desolation of the South was
<i>for naught</i>; that her very fidelity, heroism, and
fortitude, qualities so noble in themselves, had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_373' name='Page_373' href='#Page_373'>373</a></span>
wrought her undoing, that I seemed to become
dead to everything around me. My husband was
compelled to leave me, to seek employment in
Richmond. My neighbors, like myself, were stunned
into silence. "Here I and sorrow sit" might have
been said truly of any one of us.
</p>

<p>
When the passing troops left us with only General
Hartsuff's guard, the small earnings of my little
boys ceased. John and his fellow-servants came
into town, and reported to me.
</p>

<p>
"I can no longer maintain you or give you
wages," I said to Eliza Page and her sisters.
</p>

<p>
"We will serve you for the good you have
already done us," they said, but of course I could
not allow this to any extent. Eliza returned to
her husband and their little home.
</p>

<p>
With John I had more trouble. It was hard
to make him understand that I could not afford
his services on any terms.
</p>

<p>
"I will never leave you," was his reply to everything
I urged.
</p>

<p>
"You <i>must</i>, John! You must go home to your
father in Norfolk. He will advise you."
</p>

<p>
"The old man is in the oyster business," said
John. "What do I care about oysters? All I
care for is Marse Roger and these boys."
</p>

<p>
I knew that my poor John had an infirmity.
Once when I had sent him with Alick from Cottage
Farm on an errand he had returned very late.
I could see the pair walking down the road alone,
followed at some distance by the horse and wagon.
They seemed to be trying to compass both sides of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_374' name='Page_374' href='#Page_374'>374</a></span>
the road at once. Alick was the first to report to
me, with these words:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Iâ€”I-ain' drunk,â€”but <i>Jawn</i>! Jawn, he
<i>ve'y</i> drunk!"
</p>

<p>
This painful scene had been reÃ«nacted often enough
to make me anxious.
</p>

<p>
"You really must go to your father, John," I
insisted. "How much money have you?" He
had five dollars. I also had five, which I gave him.
</p>

<p>
"Now don't let me see you again," I said.
"Write to me from Norfolk."
</p>

<p>
He left, protesting, but next morning he was
gone. I heard from him soon and from his father.
The old gentleman expressed gratitude and also
some anxiety about John's "army habits."
</p>

<p>
And so no more of the only slave I ever owned!
</p>

<p>
Agnes wrote from Richmond early in May:â€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"<span class="smcap">My Dearest</span>: What could I do without you? Now
don't flatter yourself that I need now, or ever did need, those
beautiful moral reflections in well-chosen language by means
of which you have striven to educate me. But you are an
unmitigated blessing when my 'feelings are too many for
me'â€”when, in short, I boil over.
</p>

<p>
"Now when a kettle boils over it puts out the fire, and
then we go tea-less to bed. How nice it would be for the
kettle if some convenient utensil were at hand to receive its
excited bubbles.
</p>

<p>
"I am aggrieved and indignant at the sermons people are
preaching to us. And I have caught a young brother in a
flagrant theft. All Richmond is in a state of beautiful
admiration at a sermon it listened to last week on the uses
of our great misfortune. War was declared to be a blessing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_375' name='Page_375' href='#Page_375'>375</a></span>
'The high passion of patriotism prevents the access of baser
passions. Men's hearts beat together, and woman is roused
from the frivolousness and feebleness into which her nature
is apt to sink. Death, insult, carnage, violated homes, and
broken hearts are all awful. But it is worse than a thousand
deaths when a people has adopted the creed that the wealth
of nations consistsâ€”not in generous hearts, in primitive
simplicity, in preference of duty to life; not in <span class="smcap">MEN</span>, but in
silk, cotton, and something that they call "capital." If the
price to be paid for peace is thisâ€”that wealth accumulates
and men decay, better far that every street in every town
of our once noble country should run blood.'
</p>

<p>
"Now all this is very fine, but very one-sided. And my
brother didn't believe a word of it. He has been away in
England and has seen none of the horrors of war; but he
has seen something elseâ€”a very charming lecture printed
in London some time before the war.<a name='FA_25' id='FA_25' href='#FN_25' class='fnanchor'>[25]</a>
</p>

<p>
"Strange are the ways of Providence. Precisely that I
might convict him did this address fall into my hands in
Washington. It struck me forcibly at the time. Little
did I think I should hear it in Richmond after a terrible
civil war of our own.
</p>

<p>
"I feel impatient at this attempt to extort good for ourselves
out of the overwhelming disaster which brought such
ruin to others; to congratulate ourselves for what is purchased
with their blood. Surely, if for no other reason,
for the sake of the blood that has been spilt, we should not
hasten to acquiesce in the present state of things. If I
catch my Colonel piously affirming too much resignation,
too prompt a forgetfulness of the past, I'llâ€”well, he knows
what I am capable of saying!
</p>

<p>
"But, now that I have safely boiled over, I will tell you
my news. We cannot remain here. We are literally
stripped to the 'primitive' state my reverend brother thinks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_376' name='Page_376' href='#Page_376'>376</a></span>
so good for us. We are wofully in need of 'silk, cotton,
and something they call capital,' and we'll never get it here.
And so my Colonel and I are going to New York. He has
secured a place in some publishing house or other. I only
wish it were a dry-goods store!
</p>

<p>
"Of course our social life is all over. I have taken my
resolution. There are fine ladies in New York whom I
used to entertain in Washington. Just so far as they
approach me, will I approach them! A card for a card, a
visit for a visit. But I imagine I shall not be recognized.
I am content. There will be plenty to read in that publishing
house. I shall not repine. All the setting, the <i><span lang="fr_FR">entourage</span></i>,
of a lady is taken from me, but the lady herself has herself
pretty well in hand, and is quite content if she may always
be

<p>
The time now came when I must draw rations
for my family. I could not do this by proxy. I
was required to present my request in person.
</p>

<p>
As I walked through the streets in early morning,
I thought I had never known a lovelier day.
How could Nature spread her canopy of blossoming
magnolia and locust as if nothing had happened?
How could the vine over the doorway of my old
home load itself with snowy roses, how could the
birds sing, how could the sun shine as if such things
as these could ever again gladden our broken hearts?
</p>

<p>
My dear little sons understood they were to
escort me everywhere, so we presented ourselves
together at the desk of the government official and
announced our errand.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_377' name='Page_377' href='#Page_377'>377</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Have you taken the oath of allegiance,
Madam?" inquired that gentleman.
</p>

<p>
"No, Sir." I was quite prepared to take the oath.
</p>

<p>
The young officer looked at me seriously
for a moment, and said, as he wrote out the
order:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Neither will I require it of you, Madam!"
</p>

<p>
I was in better spirits after this pleasant incident,
and, calling to Alick, I bade him arm himself with
the largest basket he could find and take my order
to the commissary.
</p>

<p>
"We are going to have all sorts of good things,"
I told him, "fresh meat, fruit, vegetables, and
everything."
</p>

<p>
When the boy returned he presented a drooping
figure and a woebegone face. My first unworthy
suspicion suggested his possible confiscation of my
stores for drink, but he soon explained.
</p>

<p>
"I buried that ole stinkin' fish! I wouldn't
bring it in your presence. An' here's the meal
they give me."
</p>

<p>
Hairy caterpillars were jumping through the
meal! I turned to my table and wrote:â€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Is the commanding general aware of the nature of the
ration issued this day to the destitute women of Petersburg?"
(signing myself)
</p>

<p class="sigright">
"<span class="smcap">Mrs. Roger A. Pryor</span>."
</p>
</div> <!-- /blockquot -->

<p>
This I gave to Alick, with instructions to present
it, with the meal, to General Hartsuff.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_378' name='Page_378' href='#Page_378'>378</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Alick returned with no answer; but in a few minutes
a tall orderly stood before me, touched his cap,
and handed me a note.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Major-General Hartsuff is sorry he cannot make <i>right</i>
all that seems so wrong. He sends the enclosed. Some
day General Pryor will repay
</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">"<span class="smcap">George L. Hartsuff</span>,</span><br />
"<i>Major-General Commanding</i>."
</p>
</div> <!-- /blockquot -->

<p>
The note contained an official slip of paper:â€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The Quartermaster and Commissary of the Army of
the Potomac are hereby ordered to furnish Mrs. Roger A.
Pryor with all she may demand or require, charging the

"<i>Major-General Commanding</i>."
</p>

<p>
Without the briefest deliberation I wrote and
returned the following reply:â€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Mrs. Roger A. Pryor is not insensible to the generous
offer of Major-General Hartsuff, but <i>he ought to have known</i>

<p>
As I sat alone, revolving various schemes for our
sustenance,â€”the selling of the precious testimonial
service (given by the Democracy of Virginia after
my husband's noble fight against "Know-nothingism"),
the possibility of finding occupation for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_379' name='Page_379' href='#Page_379'>379</a></span>
myself,â€”the jingling of chain harness at the door
arrested my attention. There stood a handsome
equipage, from which a very fine lady indeed was
alighting. She bustled in with her lace-edged handkerchief
to her eyes, and announced herself as Mrs.
Hartsuff. She was superbly gowned in violet silk
and lace, with a tiny <i><span lang="fr_FR">fanchon</span></i> bonnet tied beneath
an enormous cushion of hair behind, the first of the
fashionable <i><span lang="fr_FR">chignons</span></i> I had seenâ€”an arrangement
called a "waterfall," an exaggeration of the plethoric,
distended "bun" of the Englishwoman of a few
years ago.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my dear lady," she began, "we are in such
distress at headquarters! George is in despair!
You won't let him help you! Whatever is he to
do?"
</p>

<p>
"I really am grateful to the General," I assured
her; "but you see there is no reason he should do
more for me than for others."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but there <i>is</i> reason. You have suffered
more than the rest. You have been driven from
your home! Your house has been sacked. George
knows all about you. I have brought a basket for
youâ€”tea, coffee, sugar, crackers."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot accept it, I am so sorry."
</p>

<p>
"But what are you going to do? Are you going
to starve?"
</p>

<p>
"Very likely," I said, "but somehow I shall not
very much mind!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, this is too utterly, utterly dreadful!" said
the lady as she left the room.
</p>

<p>
The next day the ration was changed. Fresh
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_380' name='Page_380' href='#Page_380'>380</a></span>
beef, canned vegetables, bread, and coffee were issued
to all the women of Petersburg. Mrs. Hartsuff
came daily to see me. "Not that George has
gotten over it!" she declared. "His feelings are
constantly hurt here. And as to myself, that old
black Irene I found in the kitchen at Centre Hill
just walks over me!"
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you dismiss her?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Dismiss Irene?</i> I should like to see anybody
dismiss Irene! Besides, she cooks divinely. But
I can't enter her kitchen! 'Dear me,' I said one
day, '<i>what</i> a dirty kitchen!' 'Ladies don't nuvver
come in kitchens,' she told me. Evidently I am
not a lady! And I once asked her please to be
careful of the gold studs the General was apt to leave
in his cuffs 'Gold studs!' she repeated with a sniff,
'my master wore diamond studs, an' I never see
cuffs loose from shirts before in all my born days.
'Cose the wind'll blow 'em away! I can't be 'sponsible
for no shirt that's in three or four pieces.'"
</p>

<p>
All the good citizens of Petersburg who had been
driven away by the shelling now began to return,
and among them came the owners of the house I
was occupying. I was told that I could, on no
account, be safe at Cottage Farm without a guard.
For this, too, I must make personal request. So my
little body-guard and I wended our way to interview
General Hartsuff.
</p>

<p>
We found him in the noble mansion of the Bollings.
At the entrance two fine greyhounds in
marble had for many years guarded the incoming
and outgoing of the Bolling family. In the rear
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_381' name='Page_381' href='#Page_381'>381</a></span>
there was a long veranda with lofty pillars, and
beyond, extensive grounds set with well-grown evergreens,
and with that princely tree, the <i><span lang="la">magnolia
grandiflora</span></i>, now in bloom. White marble statues
and marble seats were scattered through the grounds.
A rustic staircase led down to a conservatory, built
low for the better care of the plants. The mansion
stood on an eminence sloping sharply in front, and
a legend-haunted subterranean passage led from the
dwelling to the street, the entrance to which was
covered by shrubs and vines.
</p>

<p>
As I stood in the veranda waiting for audience, a
young officer called my attention to the beauty of
the grounds and the magnificence of the flowering
plants in tubs on the veranda. "I should like," he
said, "to fight it out on this line all summer."
</p>

<p>
I thought of the family driven from their own,
and was wicked enough to tell him:â€”
</p>

<p>
"That would be most unfortunate for you. This
place is very sickly in summerâ€”deadly, in fact.
Typhoid fever is fatal in this section."
</p>

<p>
But I was summoned to the presence of the great
man. As I entered, he continued writing at a
table, without greeting me or looking up from his
paper.
</p>

<p>
"General," I commenced, "I have come to ask
if I may have a guard. I am about to return to my
homeâ€”Cottage Farm."
</p>

<p>
No answer, except the rapid scratching of his pen
as it travelled over his sheet.
</p>

<p>
"General Hartsuff, are you still angry with me
because I did not feel I could accept your kind offer?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_382' name='Page_382' href='#Page_382'>382</a></span>
I couldn't take it! I couldn't trust myself with it!
I should have given a ball and ruined you."
</p>

<p>
He laughed outright at this and threw down his
pen.
</p>

<p>
"It is impossible for you to go to Cottage
Farm," he said; "there are fifty or more negroes
on the place. You cannot live there."
</p>

<p>
"I must! it is my only shelter."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, I'll allow you a guard, and Mrs.
Hartsuff had better take you out herself, that is,
if you can condescend to accept as much."
</p>

<p>
I was not aware that Mrs. Hartsuff had entered
and stood behind me.
</p>

<p>
"And I think, George," she said, "you ought to
give Mrs. Pryor a horse and cart in place of her
own that were stolen."
</p>

<p>
"All right, all right," he said hastily. "Madam,
you will find the guard at your door when you arrive.
You go this evening? All rightâ€”good morning."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Hartsuff duly appeared in the late afternoon
with an ambulance and four horses, and we
departed in fine style. She was very cheery and
agreeable, and made me promise to let her come
often to see me. As we were galloping along in
state, we passed a line of weary-looking, dusty
Confederate soldiers, limping along, on their way
to their homes. They stood aside to let us pass.
I was cut to the heart at the spectacle. Here was
I, accepting the handsome equipage of the invading
commanderâ€”I, who had done nothing, going
on to my comfortable home; while they, poor fellows,
who had borne long years of battle and starvation,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_383' name='Page_383' href='#Page_383'>383</a></span>
were mournfully returning on foot, to find,
perhaps, no home to shelter them. "Never again,"
I said to myself, "shall this happen! If I cannot
help, I can at least suffer with them."
</p>

<p>
But when I reached Cottage Farm I found a
home that no soldier, however forlorn, could have
envied me. A scene of desolation met my eyes.
The earth was ploughed and trampled, the grass
and flowers were gone, the carcasses of six dead
cows lay in the yard, and filth unspeakable had
gathered in the corners of the house. The evening
air was heavy with the sickening odor of decaying
flesh. As the front door opened, millions of flies
swarmed forth.
</p>

<p>
"If this were I," said Mrs. Hartsuff, as she
gathered her skirts as closely around her as her
hoops would permit, "I should fall across this
threshold and die."
</p>

<p>
"I shall not fall," I said proudly; "I shall stand
in my lot."
</p>

<p>
Within was dirt and desolation. Pieces of fat
pork lay on the floors, molasses trickled from the
library shelves, where bottles lay uncorked. Filthy,
malodorous tin cans were scattered on the floors.
Nothing, not even a tin dipper to drink out of the
well, was left in the house, except one chair out of
which the bottom had been cut, and one bedstead
fastened together with bayonets. Picture frames
were piled against the wall. I eagerly examined
them. Every one was empty. One family portrait
of an old lady was hanging on the wall with a
sabre-cut across her face.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_384' name='Page_384' href='#Page_384'>384</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Now, what in the world are you going to do?"
asked Mrs. Hartsuff.
</p>

<p>
"The best I can," I said.
</p>

<p>
But old Aunt Jinny had espied me, and, with a
courtesy to Mrs. Hartsuff, had seized my little girl.
</p>

<p>
"This is a hard home-coming for you, my po'
lamb! But never mind! Jinny has got plenty
of clean bedclothes and things. Yes, marm" (to
Mrs. Hartsuff), "I can take care of 'em! The
colored people? Oh, the colored people will give
no trouble. They are very peaceable."
</p>

<p>
She gathered us into her kitchen while she swept
a room for us and spread quilts upon the floor.
Later in the evening an ambulance from Mrs.
Hartsuff drove up. She had sent me a tin box of
bread-and-butter sandwiches, some tea, an army cot,
and army bedding.
</p>

<p>
The guard, a great, tall fellow, came to me for
orders. I felt nervous at his presence and wished
I had not brought him. I directed him to watch
all night at the road side of the house, while I
would sit up and keep watch in the opposite direction.
The children soon slept upon the floor.
</p>

<p>
As the night wore on, I grew extremely anxious
about the strange negroes. Aunt Jinny thought
there were not more than fifty. They had filled
every outhouse except the kitchen. Suppose they
should overpower the guard and murder us all.
</p>

<p>
Everything was quiet. I had not the least disposition
to sleepâ€”thinking, thinking, of all the
old woman had told me of the sacking of the house,
of the digging of the cellar in search of treasure, of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_385' name='Page_385' href='#Page_385'>385</a></span>
the torch that had twice been applied to the house,
and twice withdrawn because some officer wanted
the shaded dwelling for a temporary lodging. Presently
I was startled by a shrill scream from the
kitchen, a door opened suddenly and shut, and
a voice cried, "Thank Gawd! Thank Gawd
A'mighty." Then all was still.
</p>

<p>
Was this a signal? I held my breath and listened,
then softly rose, closed the shutters and
fastened them, crept to the door, and bolted it
inside. I might defend my children till the guard
could come.
</p>

<p>
Evidently he had not heard! He was probably
sleeping the sleep of an untroubled conscience on
the bench in the front porch. And with untroubled
consciences my children were sleeping. It was so
dark in the room I could not see their faces, but I
could touch them, and push the wet locks from
their brows, as they lay in the close and heated
atmosphere.
</p>

<p>
I resumed my watch at the window, pressing my
face close to the slats of the shutters. A pale half-moon
hung low in the sky, turning its averted face
from a suffering world. At a little distance I could
see the freshly made soldier's grave which Alick had
discovered and reported. A heavy rain had fallen
in the first hours of the night, and a stiff arm and
hand now protruded from the shallow grave. To-morrow
I would reverently cover the appealing arm,
be it clad in blue or in gray, and would mark the
spot. Now, as I sat with my fascinated gaze upon
it, I thought of the tens of thousands, of the hundreds
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_386' name='Page_386' href='#Page_386'>386</a></span>
of thousands, of upturned faces beneath the
green sod of old Virginia. Strong in early manhood,
brave, high-spirited men of genius, men
whom their country had educated for her own
defence in time of peril,â€”they had died because
that country could devise in her wisdom no better
means of settling a family quarrel than the wholesale
slaughter of her sons by the sword. And now?
"Not till the heavens be no more shall they awake
nor be raised out of their sleep."
</p>

<p>
And then, as I sorrowed for their early death in
loneliness and anguish, I remembered the white-robed
souls beneath the altar of God,â€”the souls
that had "come out of great tribulation,"â€”and
<i>because</i> they had thus suffered "they shall hunger
no more, neither thirst any more; ... and God
shall wipe away all tears from their eyes."
</p>

<p>
And then, as the pale, distressful moon sank
behind the trees, and the red dawn streamed up
from the east, the angel of Hope, who had "spread
her white wings and sped her away" for a little
season, returned. And Hope held by the hand an
angel stronger than she, who bore to me a message:
"In the world ye have tribulation: but be of good
cheer; I have overcome the world."
</p>

<p>
The sun was rising when I saw my good old
friend emerge from her kitchen, and I opened the
shutters to greet her. She had brought me a cup
of delicious coffee, and was much distressed because
I had not slept. Had I heard anything?
</p>

<p>
"Course I know you was bleeged to hear," said
Aunt Jinny, as she bustled over the children. "That
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_387' name='Page_387' href='#Page_387'>387</a></span>
was Sis' Winny! She got happy in the middle of the
night, an' Gawd knows what she would have done,
if Frank hadn't ketched hold of her and pulled her
back in the kitchen! Frank an' me is pretty nigh
outdone an' discouraged 'bout Sis' Winny. She
prays constant all day; but Gawd A'mighty don't
count on bein' bothered all night. Ain' He 'ranged
for us all to sleep, an' let Him have a little peace?
Sis' Winny must keep her happiness to herself, when
folks is trying to git some res'."
</p>

<p>
The guard now came to my window to say he
"guessed" he'd "have to put on some more harness.
Them blamed niggers refused to leave.
They might change their minds when they saw the
pistols."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you wouldn't shoot, would you?" I said,
in great distress. "Call them all to the back door
and let me speak with them." I found myself in
the presence of some seventy-five negroes, men,
women, and children, all with upturned faces, keenly
interested in what I should say to them.
</p>

<p>
I talked to them kindly, and told them I was
sorry to see so many of them without homes. One
of them, an intelligent-looking man, interrupted me.
</p>

<p>
"We are not without homes," he said. "I planted
and worked on this place for years before the war.
It is right I should have some choice in the land
the government promises us, and I have come here
because I shall ask for the land I have worked."
</p>

<p>
"You are mistaken, I am sure," I said. "This
farm belongs to my brother, not to me. I am here
through his kindness, and I am perfectly willing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_388' name='Page_388' href='#Page_388'>388</a></span>
you should remain through mine until you find
other shelter, provided you consider my husband
master here, give no trouble, and help me clean up
this place. All who are not willing to do this must
leave. You must distinctly understand this is
private property which will be protected by the
government."
</p>

<p>
"That's so!" said the guard, emphatically.
Thereupon an old, gray-haired man stepped forth
and said:â€”
</p>

<p>
"My name's Abram! I'se toted Marse Roger
on my back to school many a time. Me an' my
family will stay an' clean up, an' thank you, Mistis!
Come now! You all hear what the Yankee gentleman
say! Git to work now on them dead cowsâ€”hurry
up!"
</p>

<p>
I sent Abram to the quartermaster, and borrowed
a team to haul away the filth and the dead
animals. My faithful old friend in the kitchen lent
me chairs and a table, and before night we were
comparatively clean, having had a score or more
scrubbers, and as many out-of-door laborers at
work. My husband returned to us, and we commenced
our new life of hopeless destitution. Not
before October could I get my consent to eat a
morsel in the house. I took my meals under the
trees, unless driven by the rains to the shelter of the
porch. The old woman who had been so unreasonably
happyâ€”"Sis' Winny"â€”proved to be a mere
atom of a creature, withered, and bent almost double
with age and infirmities, whom Aunt Jinny had
taken in out of sheer compassion. If she could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_389' name='Page_389' href='#Page_389'>389</a></span>
find something for which to thank God, surely none
need despair.
</p>

<p>
To my great joy, my dear General had not
remained in Richmond. There was no hope there
for immediate occupation. His profession of law, for
which he had been educated, promised nothing,
for the very good reason that he had forgotten all
he ever knew in his later profession of editor and
politician. The latter field was closed to him forever.
There was nothing for a rebel to earn in
editing a newspaper.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXVI
<br />
<span class="s05">STARTING LIFE ANEW</span>
</h2>

<p>
We suffered terribly during the ensuing
months for want of something in which
we might occupy ourselves. We sat
silently, looking out on a landscape marked here
and there by chimneys standing sentinel over the
blackened heaps where our neighbors had made
happy homes. A few books had been saved, only
those for which we had little use. A soldier walked
in one day with a handsome volume which Jefferson
Davis, after inscribing his name in it, had presented
to the General. The soldier calmly requested
the former owner to be kind enough to add to the
value of the volume by writing beneath the inscription
his own autograph, and, his request granted,
walked off with it under his arm. "He has been
at some trouble," said my husband, "and he had
as well be happy if I cannot!"
</p>

<p>
As the various brigades moved away from our
neighborhood a few plain articles of furniture that
had been taken from the house were restored to us,
but nothing handsome or valuable, no books, pictures,
<i><span lang="fr_FR">bric-Ã -brac</span></i>, or house-furnishings of any kindâ€”just
a few chairs and tables. I had furnished an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_391' name='Page_391' href='#Page_391'>391</a></span>
itemized list of all the articles we had lost, with only
this result.
</p>

<p>
We had news after a while of our blooded mare,
Lady Jane. A letter enclosing her photograph
came from a New England officer:â€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="post">
"<span class="smcap">To Mr. Pryor</span>,
</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: A very fine mare belonging to you came
into my camp near Richmond and is now with me. It
would add much to her value if I could get her pedigree.
Kindly send it at your earliest convenience, and oblige
</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l8">"Yours truly,</span><br />
â€”â€” â€”â€”
</p>

<p>
"P.S. The mare is in good health, as you will doubtless
be glad to know."
</p>
</div> <!-- /blockquot -->

<p>
Disposed as my General was to be amiable, this
was a little too much! The pedigree was not sent.
</p>

<p>
A great number of tourists soon began to pass
our house on their way to visit the localities near
us, now become historic. They wished to stand on
the site of General Lee's headquarters, to pluck a
blade of grass from the hollow of the crater, to visit
the abattis, lunettes, and fortifications of both lines,
especially Fort Steadman, Fort Gregg, and Battery
45, where the lines were broken the last of March
and on April 2.
</p>

<p>
These tourists, men and women, would pause at
the well, some on horseback, others in the dilapidated
landaus or buggies for hire in Petersburg.
Uncle Frank, with his flow of courteous language
and his attractive manners, would usually meet and
discourse to them, earning many a <i><span lang="fr_FR">douceur</span></i> by drawing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_392' name='Page_392' href='#Page_392'>392</a></span>
from the well the cold water for which it was famous.
Abram's family was abroad in the fields, where the
old man had planted corn in Juneâ€”too late to hope
for other harvest than the fodder to feed the horse
the quartermaster had given him at my earnest
request. Under the impression that we were still
working our negroes, some of the tourists would
dismount and harangue Abram at length upon his
"rights." The old man would listen respectfully,
shaking his gray head dubiously as they rode off.
"Recollect, boy," said one of these travellers to
Alick, "the white woman in that house is now <i>your</i>
slave!" Alick was standing beneath my window,
amusing himself by tying up a rosebush. He looked
up, simply advising me,â€”"Let 'em go 'long,"â€”and
resumed his work in training the rosebush.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the tourists would ask permission to
call on us, claiming some common acquaintance.
My husband was inclined to resent this. Their
sympathetic attitude was offensive to him. Like the
Douglas he had endured much, butâ€”
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Last and worst, to spirit proud</p>
<p>To bear the pity of the crowd:"â€”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
this was more than he could endure.
</p>

<p>
We were perfectly aware that they wished to see <i>us</i>,
and not to gain, as they affected, information about
the historic localities on the farm. Still less did they
desire ignobly to triumph over us. A boy, when
he tears off the wings of a fly, is much interested in
observing its actions, not that he is cruelâ€”far from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_393' name='Page_393' href='#Page_393'>393</a></span>
it! He is only curious to see how the creature will
behave under very disadvantageous circumstances.
</p>

<p>
One day a clergyman called, with a card of introduction
from Mrs. Hartsuff, who had, I imagine,
small discernment as regards clergymen. This one
was a smug little man,â€”sleek, unctuous, and trim,
with Pecksniffian self-esteem oozing out of every
pore of his face.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Madam," he commenced, "I trust I find
you lying meekly under the chastening rod of
the Lord. I trust you can say 'it is good I was
afflicted.'"
</p>

<p>
Having no suitable answer just ready, I received
his pious exhortation in silence. One can always
safely do this with a clergyman.
</p>

<p>
"There are seasons," continued the good man,
"when chastisement must be meted out to the transgressor;
but if borne in the right spirit, the rod may
blossom with blessings in the end."
</p>

<p>
A little more of the same nature wrung from me
the query, "Are there none on the other side who
need the rod?"
</p>

<p>
"Ohâ€”well, nowâ€”my dear lady! You must
consider! You were in the wrong in this unhappy
contest, or, I should say, this most righteous war."
</p>

<p>
"<i><span lang="la">VÃ¦ victis!</span></i>" I exclaimed. "Our homes were
invaded. We are on our own soil!"
</p>

<p>
My reverend brother grew red in the face. Rising
and bowing himself out, he sent me a Parthian
arrow:â€”
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"No thief e'er felt the halter draw</p>
<p>With good opinion of the law."</p>
</div></div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_394' name='Page_394' href='#Page_394'>394</a></span>
</p>

<p>
On the afternoon of a sultry day, a black cloud
suddenly darkened the sky, thundered, lightened, and
poured down a pelting storm of hailstones and rain.
A party of young people galloped up to the gate,
hastily dismounted, and ran for the shelter of our
porch. There were half a dozen or more young
girls and men. The small roof affording them scant
shelter, I invited them into the parlor, where they
stood dripping and shivering until a fire was kindled.
A sudden cold wind came on with the hail. It had been
a long time since I had seen happy, cheerful young
girls in their riding-habits, and I fell in love with
them at once, putting them at ease, chafing their
hands, and drying their little coats. I never saw
young folk so much embarrassed. They were
Northern tourists, and felt the full force of our
relative positions. When hot tea was brought in,
they were overwhelmed. I was loath to give them
upâ€”these pretty girls. When they bade me good-by
and thanked me for my nice tea and fire, the black
eyes of one little beauty snapped with an unmistakable
expressionâ€”"for your coals of fire!"
</p>

<p>
Such incidents as these were our only events.
Our friends in town were in too much poverty and
sorrow to visit us. A deadly silence and apathy
had succeeded the storm. It was a long time
before the community waked up from this apathyâ€”not,
indeed, until the cool, invigorating weather
of autumn. The blood-soaked soil and the dead
animals emitted sickening odors until the frosts
came to chain them up.
</p>

<p>
A bachelor friend occasionally visited us and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_395' name='Page_395' href='#Page_395'>395</a></span>
invited the little boys to accompany him upon relic-hunting
expeditions to the narrow plain which had
divided the opposing lines on that fateful April
morning, just three months before. Ropes were
fastened around extinct shells, and they were hauled
in, to stand sentinel at the door. The shells were
short cylinders, with one pointed end like a candle
before it is lighted. Numbers of minie balls were
dug out of the sand.
</p>

<p>
One day Mr. Kemp brought in a great curiosityâ€”two
bullets welded together, having been shot from
opposing rifles.
</p>

<p>
Twenty years afterward I showed this twin-bullet
to General Grant, not long before his last illness.
With Mrs. Grant, he had called at my home in
Brooklyn to inquire if I had good news of General
Pryor, who was in England, having been sent by
Irish Americans to see what could be done for O'Donnell,
the Irish prisoner. General Grant was much
interested in this case. He found me at my late
breakfast of tea, toast, and a dozen oysters, which
were divided among the three of us. After breakfast
I brought out the bullet. He laid it on the
palm of his hand and looked at it long and earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"See, General," I said, "the bullets are welded
together so as to form a perfect horseshoeâ€”a
charm to keep away witches and evil spirits."
</p>

<p>
But the General was not interested in amulets,
charms, or evil spirits. After regarding it silently
for a moment, he remarked:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Those are minie balls, shot from rifles of equal
caliber. And they met precisely equidistant to a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_396' name='Page_396' href='#Page_396'>396</a></span>
hair. This is very interesting, but it is not the only
one in the world. I have seen one other, picked up
at Vicksburg. Where was this found and when?"
he asked, as he handed the relic back to me. "At
Petersburg, possibly."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I answered, "but not when you were shelling
the city. It was
picked up on our farm
after the last fight."
</p>

<p>
He looked at me
with a humorous twinkle
in his eye. "Now
look here," he said,
"don't you go about
telling people I
shelled Petersburg."
</p>

<div class="figleft">

<img src="images/i-429.jpg" width="206" height="269" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Met Bullets found near Fort Gregg,
1865.</p>
</div>

<p>
A short time before
his death, just
before he was taken
to Mount McGregor,
he dictated a note to
me, sending his kind
regards to my General,
and saying he
remembered with
pleasure his talk with me over a cup of tea.
</p>

<p>
But we must return (and I am sure I am pardoned
for this digression) to the weary life of enforced
idleness at the cottage.
</p>

<p>
I had no garments to mend or to make, no
household to manage. The sultry days were
begun and rounded by hours of listless endurance,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_397' name='Page_397' href='#Page_397'>397</a></span>
followed by troubled sleep. A bag of army "hardtack"
stood in a corner, so the children were never
hungry. Presently they, too, sat around us, too
listless to play or talk. A great army of large,
light brown Norway rats now overran the farm.
They would walk to the corner before our eyes
and help themselves to the army ration. We never
moved a finger to drive them away. After a while
Alick appeared with an enormous black-and-white
cat.
</p>

<p>
"Dis is jest a leetle mo'n I can stand," said
Alick. "De Yankees has stole ev'rything, and
dug up de whole face o' the yearthâ€”and de Jews
comes all de time and pizens de well, droppin'
down chains an' grapplin'-irons to see ef we all has
hid silverâ€”but I ain' obleedged to stan' sassyness
fum dese outlandish rats."
</p>

<p>
Alick had to surrender. The very first night
after the arrival of his valiant cat there was a scuffle
in the room where the crackers were kept, a chair
was overturned, and a flying cat burst through the
hall, pursued by three or four huge rats. The cat
took refuge in a tree, and, stealthily descending at
an opportune moment, stole away and left the field
to the enemy.
</p>

<p>
Of course there could be but one result from
this life. Malaria had hung over us for weeks, and
now one after another of the children lay down
upon the "pallets" on the floor, ill with fever.
Then I succumbed and was violently ill. Our only
nurse was my dear General; and not in all the
years when he never shirked duty, or lost a march,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_398' name='Page_398' href='#Page_398'>398</a></span>
or rode on his own horse when his men had a toilsome
march or if one of them failed by the way,
and never lost one of the battles into which he
personally led them,â€”not in all those trying times
was he nobler, grander, than in his long and lonely
vigils beside his sick family. And most nobly did
the aged negress in the kitchen stand by us. My
one fevered vision was of an ebony angel!
</p>

<p>
After we recovered, my dear husband was illâ€”ague
and fever had fastened on him. When he,
too, grew better, he would sit for days in hopeless
despair, looking out on the desolate landscape.
</p>

<p>
General Hartsuff and his wife often visited us.
They were terribly afraid of fever, and would send
in messages from the gate while we were all so ill.
But after we had recovered, General Hartsuff came
himselfâ€”and finally sent Captain Gregory, the
commissary-general, to see me, and to reason
seriously with me about the necessity of sending
General Pryor away. He had never been pardoned.
There were men in power who constantly hinted at
punishment and retribution. General Pryor would
die here. He should go to New York, go by sea,
shake off the chills that shook him so relentlessly
every third day, meet friends (many Southerners
were in New York), and something might result
for his benefit.
</p>

<p>
This idea grew in our minds as feasible, if only
we had the money. It had never occurred to me
to make a second attempt (one had failed) to sell
my watch. I now took it to a banker in Petersburg,
added to it a cherished antique cameo set in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_399' name='Page_399' href='#Page_399'>399</a></span>
diamonds which had never left my finger since it
was given me, like Shylock's turquoise from his
Leah, when my husband "was a bachelor."
Leaving these in pledge, I received three hundred
dollars. I bought some quinine forthwith, ordered
a suit of clothes to replace the threadbare Confederate
gray, and sent Roger A. Pryor, the sometime
"rebel," to New York, upon an experiment of which
the most sanguine imagination could not have foreseen
the successful result.
</p>

<p>
A difficult task lay before him. Ruined in fortune,
his occupation gone, his friends dead or impoverished,
his health impaired, his heart broken,
he had yet to win support for a wife and seven
children, and that in a hostile community. Only
two things were left to himâ€”the ability to work
and the willingness to work. With what courage
he commenced the study of his profession, what
difficulties he surmounted, what rebuffs he bore
with fortitude, I can give here no adequate idea.
He labored incessantly, often breaking down and
fainting, at his task. In one of his early letters he
says, "Sometimes I sink in despair; but then I rally
and press on. Don't you think heaven will prosper
me for <i>your</i> sake? The obstacles to the success of
'a rebel' in this city are almost insurmountable."
</p>

<p>
He accepted a position on the <i>Daily News</i> which
yielded him twenty-five dollars a week. Meanwhile
he must learn New York law.
</p>

<p>
There has been too much sorrow already in this
story. Why tell of all the anguish, all the suffering
of the next years? During the long, lonely winter
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_400' name='Page_400' href='#Page_400'>400</a></span>
of 1865 my husband nobly strove to sustain my
hopes, and for his sake I would not allow my heart
to break.
</p>

<p>
Early in February old Abram, the faithful servant
in whose care my husband left me, announced that
we had reached the end of all our resources at
Cottage Farm. Rose, the little cow, had died, the
turnips and potatoes Abram had raised were all
gone, the two pigs he had reared had fulfilled their
destiny long ago, and the government rations had
ceased. He "could scuffle along himself, but 't
wa'n't no use to pertend" he could "take care of
Mistis an' the chilluns, not like they ought to be
took care of."
</p>

<p>
"We must not despair, Abram," I said. "We'll
feed the children, never fear! I must plan something
to help."
</p>

<p>
"Plannin' ain't no 'count, Mistis, less'n you got
sump'n to work on. What we all goin' to do for
wood?"
</p>

<p>
"What you have done all along, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"No'm. Dat's onpossible. We done burn up
Fort Gregg an' Battery 45. Der ain' no mo' fortifications
on de place as I knows of."
</p>

<p>
"Fortifications!" I exclaimed. "Why, Abram!
you surely haven't been burning the fortifications?"
</p>

<p>
"Hit's des like I tell you, Mistis. De las' stick's
on yo' wood-pile now."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Abram," I said gravely, "if we have
destroyed our fortificationsâ€”burned our bridgesâ€”the
time has come to change our base. We will
move into town."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_401' name='Page_401' href='#Page_401'>401</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Of course, without food or fuel, and without
Abram, we could not live in the country. The
fields were a desolate waste, with no fences to protect
a possible crop or to keep cattle within bounds.
Abram saw no hope from cultivationâ€”nothing to
"work on." He had been a refugee from a lower
plantation, and he was now inclined to put out his
children to service, and return in his old age to his
old home and to his old master, who longed to welcome
him. He was a grand old man. I doubt not
he has a warm place in the bosom of that other
Abram, the faithful, but no whit more faithful
than he.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon before our departure from Cottage
Farm, the weather was so deliciously balmy that I
walked over the garden and grounds, thinking of
the great drama that had been enacted on this spot.
The spring comes early in the lower counties of
Virginia. Already the grass was springing, and on
the trees around the well which had so often
refreshed General Lee, tender young leaves were
trembling. Our old friends the tourists now appeared
at intervals, taking in this historic ground on
their return from Florida or South Carolina, where
they had spent the winter.
</p>

<p>
The garden, which at this season had always blossomed
with early hyacinths, daffodils, snowdrops,
and the rosy spikes of the flowering almond, was
now a ploughed and trampled waste of weeds.
Under the iron-clad hoofs of the cavalry horses,
and the heavy wheels of the gun-carriages, the life
had been crushed out of the tender bulbs. Spring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_402' name='Page_402' href='#Page_402'>402</a></span>
had come to touch all scars with her gentle finger-tips.
Over all the battle-torn ground, over the grave
of the young soldier who had lain so long under my
window, over the track ploughed by shot and shell,
she had spread a delicate bloom like a smile on the
lips of the dead. A bit of color attracted my attention,
and stooping over a bramble-bush I found,
under its protection, a single spike of pink hyacinth.
When I arose with the treasure in my hand, I saw
that an elderly gentleman had alighted from his
"buggy" and was gravely considering me. He
bared his head and introduced himself. "Madame,
I am a Northern traveller. Will you give me that
little flower as a souvenir?"
</p>

<p>
"Take it!" I said; there was nothing else left,
his people had all the restâ€”and with effusive bows
and thanks he stumbled over the briers and uneven
ground to secure his delicate souvenir of a battle-ground.
</p>

<p>
Much of my last night at Cottage Farm was spent
at the window from which I had watched on that
anxious night of my first home-coming. The home
had been polluted, sacked, desecratedâ€”and yet I
was leaving it with regret. Many a hard battle with
illness, with want, with despair, had been fought
within those walls. It seemed like a long dark
night in which neither sun nor moon nor stars had
appeared; during which we had simply endured,
watching ourselves the while, jealous lest the natural
rebound of youthful hope and spirit should surprise
us, and dishonor those who had suffered and bled
and died for our sakes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_403' name='Page_403' href='#Page_403'>403</a></span>
</p>

<p>
But now the night was gone, the hour of awakening
had come. There was work for me to do in
the world; the world in which I had been divinely
taught I should "have tribulation" with the command
and promise, "Fear not! I have overcome
the world." And so, as I sat again in the darkness,
and kept my midnight vigil:â€”
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>As of old when the fire and tempest had passed,</p>
<p>And an earthquake had riven the rocks, the Word</p>
<p>In a still small voice rose over the blast,</p>
<p class="i5">The voice of the Lord.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And the Voice saidâ€”"Take up your life again,</p>
<p>Quit yourself manfully, stand in your lot;</p>
<p>Let the Fever, the Famine, the peril, the pain,</p>
<p class="i5">Be all forgot."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
That I might aid my husband to mend our fortunes,
I persuaded seven of my neighbors' children
to take music lessons from me. I had been carefully
instructed in music, having been taught by a
pupil of Liszt's, brought over by the Hon. William
C. Rives at the close of his second term as Minister
to the Court of Louis Philippe, to teach his own
daughter AmÃ©lie. So I was well equipped for my
new duties, upon which, despite my own persistent
chills and fevers, I entered with enthusiasm.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXVII
<br />
<span class="s05">THE FIRST "DECORATION DAY"</span>
</h2>

<p>
It was in May of this year 1866 that we inaugurated,
in Petersburg, the custom, now universal,
of decorating the graves of those who
fell in the Civil War. Our intention was simply
to lay a token of our gratitude and affection upon
the graves of the brave citizens who fell June 9,
1864, in defence of Petersburg, and upon the
graves of her sons who perished in the assault upon
Fort Steadman. These were buried in the cemetery
of the old Blandford Church, then a roofless,
ivy-clad ruin. The church is one of the historic
structures of the South, and it has a literature of its
own among Virginians. One of the most striking
of the poems concerning it was the following, found
written with a pencil on the inner walls of the church
many years ago. The author is unknown, but
Tyrone Power, the Irish comedian, is generally
supposed to have been the writer:â€”
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="o1">"Thou art crumbling to the dust, old pile!</p>
<p class="i1">Thou art hastening to thy fall;</p>
<p>And 'round thee in thy loneliness</p>

<p>The worshippers are scattered now,</p>
<p class="i1">Who knelt before thy shrine,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_405' name='Page_405' href='#Page_405'>405</a></span></p>
<p>And silence reigns where anthems rose</p>
<p class="i1">In days of 'auld lang syne.'</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"And sadly sighs the wandering wind</p>
<p class="i1">Where oft in years gone by</p>

<p class="i1">That sought thy aisles is o'er,</p>

<p class="o1">"How doth ambition's hope take wing!</p>
<p class="i1">How droops the spirit now!</p>
<p>We hear the distant city's din;</p>
<p class="i1">The dead are mute below.</p>
<p>The sun that shone upon their path</p>
<p class="i1">Now gilds their lowly graves,</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Oh! could we call the many back</p>
<p class="i1">Who've gathered here in vain,â€”</p>

<p>How would our very hearts be stirred</p>
<p class="i1">To meet the earnest gaze</p>
<p>Of the lovely and the beautifulâ€”</p>
<p class="i1">The lights of other days!"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
When a sentiment and observance sweeps the
country we naturally wonder who began it. Where
was the spark kindled that fired the train? Who
was the "founder"â€”that is, the originator, the
one from whom the movement derived its beginning?
</p>

<p>
Memorial associations were organized in several
places soon after the close of the war, but the first
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_406' name='Page_406' href='#Page_406'>406</a></span>
observance of a "Decoration Day" was an inspiration
of Mrs. Judge Joynes of Petersburg, Virginia.
She called the women of Petersburg together on
the 9th of May, 1866, and organized them into a
memorial association for the express purpose of
decorating the graves of the men who had fallen
in the late conflict between the North and the South.
She was made President of the association, and
Mrs. Samuel B. Paul, Vice-President. The following
preamble was offered by Mrs. Joynes and accepted
by the meeting:â€”
</p>

<p>
"Whereas, a mysterious Providence has given us
a duty which would, under other results, have been a
nation's pride to perform, we, the ladies of Petersburg,
now assume our share of the melancholy yet
grateful task of doing honor to the remains of her
noble sons. All along our lines, on distant hilltops,
in valleys, in forests, lie the neglected graves
of the slain of our people. Absent from our homes
and our altars, they sleep the last sleep of the noble
and the brave. Their bodies, bone of our bone,
flesh of our flesh, arise, a spectre band before us,
demanding Christian and honorable sepulture. Untrue
would we be to the instincts of nature, as well
as our birthright of glory, untrue to the land of
Washington and of Lee, did we not give every
energy to this work. Now that the storms of war
have been hushed for us, and the paralysis of our
crushed hopes is yielding to a healthy activity and
responsibility, we come together to devise means to
perpetuate our gratitude and admiration for those
who died for us. We, therefore, form ourselves
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_407' name='Page_407' href='#Page_407'>407</a></span>
into a society for the systematic furtherance of
this object, inviting the coÃ¶peration of all that
sympathize with us, so that here, where the last
blow was struck, an enduring monument may
arise as a tribute to true manhood and patriotic
devotion.
</p>

<p>
"We, therefore, propose," etc. In the resolutions
that followed, June 9 was named as the day
for "perpetual remembrance." Just what was to be
done on that day was not made public. The Federal
Army was still with us, and some apprehension
was felt that we might be hindered in our wishes.
Nothing was yet quite settled or clearly understood
in relation to our future. We were under military
rule, and realized the necessity of discreet behavior.
Mrs. Joynes quietly circulated notes among
us, requesting us to meet at Blandford Church on
the afternoon of June 9, "to be sure of enough
voices for an anthem." It was whispered that
"many flowers were desired." When the day came,
everybody rose early, to cut these flowers with the
dew on themâ€”otherwise they would perish in the
hot summer day.
</p>

<p>
Over the trellised porch of the house I had occupied
during the siege of Petersburg there was still
the fine specimen of the microphylla roseâ€”a grand
climbing rose to whose bounty my little girls had
been indebted, during the blockade, for the only
adornment of the home-plaited hats. This rose
had, as we have seen, already yielded its tribute to
heroism. Its globes of snow had lain upon the
breast of more than one dead soldier. To-day it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_408' name='Page_408' href='#Page_408'>408</a></span>
gave up all its wealth for the hands of my little
children and my own. The day was perfect. One
could but recall that other perfect day when so
many of the old men and boys had fallen in the
defence of the town. The flowering trees,â€”chestnut,
locust, and peerless <i><span lang="la">magnolia grandiflora</span></i> were
again in blossom. The city again lay under a cloud
of white. In all the town, lately one of the wealthiest
of the South, only two or three carriages could
be found. These led the way, filled with flowers.
Young girls followed, clad in white and bearing
garlands of flowersâ€”a long double line. Then
came every child from every school. All bore
baskets and clusters of flowers. Some had covered
large pasteboard letters with white roses, combining
them afterward to form the tender words of
"Brother" or "Father." The women and children
were followed by a band playing Beethoven's immortal
march upon the death of a hero. Military
companies and a great crowd of reverent strangers
made up the rear.
</p>

<p>
The day at one o'clock, when the procession
started, was intensely hot, and the distance to be
traversed along a dusty road more than a mile.
Upon reaching the cemetery of the old Blandford
Church a prayer was offered, followed by orations,
at two gravesâ€”one filled with the bones of men
who had perished at Fort Steadman, the other the
grave of Colonel Scott, who fell at Richmond during
the seven days' fight. Then the women and children
hastened to cover with flowers the great number
of unmarked graves. Many little white flags
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_409' name='Page_409' href='#Page_409'>409</a></span>
had been prepared for these graves. On these the
words "Somebody's darling" was printed. I remember
Miss Joynes's delicate beauty as she filled
her arms with these little banners and ran from one
lonely hillock to another to plant them. We then
gathered together in the historic church, roofless
then, and in a most picturesque phase of decay.
But the anthem written by Mrs. Morrison was
deemed too passionate for the hour. We wished to
do nothing that might be construed amiss. The
Federal soldiers were all around us, looking on respectfully;
so we raised our eyes to heaven through
the old ivy-clad walls and sang to the good old
church tune:â€”
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah,</p>
<p>Pilgrims in a stricken land."</p>
</div></div>

<p>
When all was over the sorrowful women and
children returned mournfully to their homes. The
shops of the city were closed, the streets hushed.
Thus passed the first organized observance of
Decoration Day. It has been observed in a similar
manner on some selected day in every State in the
Union, but in Petersburg it will ever be on the 9th
of June, her one saddest, greatest day of the war,
that her daughters will cover with flowers the graves
of her martyred sons.
</p>

<p>
I think well of my country that it should recognize
them as martyrs. We do well to pause one
summer day in a year to exalt their courage, to bewail
their fate, to cover their humble hillocks with
flowers. They died, not to protect our land from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_410' name='Page_410' href='#Page_410'>410</a></span>
the profane foot of the foreign invader, nor yet to
win the Holy Sepulchre from the infidel, nor yet
to conquer a savage wilderness for the great incoming
flood of our race. They died because their
country could devise, in its wisdom, no better means
of settling a family quarrel than by slaying her sons
with the sword.
</p>

<p>
May this country never forget to observe Memorial
Day! Even now there is scarcely a hamlet in
the United States that does not display a tiny flag
or bit of bunting on Decoration Day. Some years
ago I drove through a wild mountain country in
West Virginia. Deep down in a narrow gorgeâ€”one
of those strange fissures where a small stream
has cut a mountain in twainâ€”I discovered a
wretched hut. Fastened to a pole at the door was
a fluttering bit of red flannel. The half-naked
savages who lived in this hut scrambled up the
precipice to beg. I asked the meaning of the red
rag, and received the surprised answer, "Decoration
Day!" These untamed, untamable people
respected the day.

<p class="caption">OLD BLANDFORD CHURCH, PETERSBURG, VA.</p>
</div>

<p>
The old Blandford Church is still an object of
interest to all who visit the historic sites around
Petersburg. When the solemn chant of the first
Memorial, or Decoration Day, service echoed through
its mouldering walls, they, with a remnant of the roof,
were embedded in the emerald ivy brought from
Kenilworth, and were literally vocal with hundreds
of tuneful birds. It has been found necessary to
repair the roof, but enough ivy remains to cover it
in a few years. Meanwhile the old church sits
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_411' name='Page_411' href='#Page_411'>411</a></span>
desolate among the graves of her distinguished and
honored sonsâ€”indeed a <i><span lang="la">Mater Dolorosa</span></i>:â€”

<h2>
CHAPTER XXVIII
<br />
<span class="s05">VIRGINIA IN THE EARLY DAYS OF PEACE</span>
</h2>

<p>
The result of the war was to leave the state
of Virginia prostrate. It seemed it would
require generations for the commonwealth
to recover from the effects of the strife upon her
own soil, the paralysis of the merchant and the
farmer, and the consequent starvation of the people.
And yet the people refused to repine. They accepted
their lot with patience, fortitude, and dignity.
Whatever they may have felt, they forbore to give
expression to indignation or to nurse old grudges.
Northern men who visited them were treated with
courtesy. General Ordway of the Federal Army
records that "in Richmond the people behaved
with becoming reserve and dignity. I found them
reasonable, courteous, and desirous of submitting to
or coÃ¶perating with every measure necessary to good
government. I rode through the state for several
weeks accompanied only by a mounted orderly, and
never failed to receive the traditional hospitality of
Virginia."<a name='FA_26' id='FA_26' href='#FN_26' class='fnanchor'>[26]</a>
</p>

<p>
In recalling this time I cannot remember one
word of bitterness or complaint. When women
met together there was talk only of "ways and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_413' name='Page_413' href='#Page_413'>413</a></span>
means," the best to be done under the new order of
things.
</p>

<p>
In 1866 the state was under Federal government.
Francis H. Pierpont, who had been Governor
of West Virginia, assumed executive authority. In
1867 Virginia was placed under military government,
and in the winter of that year a convention
was held which framed a new constitution. This
was submitted in 1869 to the people, and was
adopted by a large majority. Gilbert C. Walker, a
native of New York and a resident of Virginia, was
elected Governor; United States Senators were
chosen; the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments
were ratified; the military occupation, which had
been found unnecessary, ceased; and Virginia resumed
her place in the Union.
</p>

<p>
As to the negroes, they gave no trouble. Individual
cases of discourteous behavior were treated
as they deserved, with compassionate forbearance.
"You will know better by and by," I said to a
negro woman who insisted upon buying her pins
and needles before I was served, and she respectfully
yielded me her place at the counter. Once when
dear old Mrs. Campbell, the venerated mother of
Virginia's historian, stopped with me in a vacant
street for a lengthy comparison of household notes,
a negro policeman sauntered up and said gruffly:
"You can't block up dis street! You suttenly is
got to 'move on.'" "And so we willâ€”and so we
will!" said the old lady, laughing. I remember on
the fourth of July, 1866, my Mary was ill, nervous,
and distressed by the firing of a toy pistol under her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_414' name='Page_414' href='#Page_414'>414</a></span>
window. I found a young negro man quietly sitting
on the curb and loading, with percussion caps,
a small pistol. To my somewhat heated remonstrance,
he solemnly and without the least anger remarked,
"Ah does ma work, an' Ah pays ma
taxes, an' <i>Ah has ma fun</i>," and went on with his
percussion caps. I thought there was reason in
his conclusion and only regretted the work and
taxes of the white man without the "fun"!
</p>

<p>
The position of the newly enfranchised negro was
a most perplexing one, and in it he bore himself
with wonderful discretion. Every possible influence
was brought to bear upon him, to make him distrust
his old friends and leave his old home. Early
in the war he had elected for himself an attitude
of perfect quiescence. The fight was a white man's
fight. "But," reasoned one of his early advisers,
"the fight is for your freedom; the whole trouble
is about you." "That's so!" answered an old man
of the "Uncle Remus" type. "When two dogs
fight, they commonly fights for a bone. Is you
ever see the bone fight?" But after the conflict
was over the negro realized that his new blessings
brought with them stern anxieties. Never having
thought for himself, he was now the prey of the ill-advised
counsels of his new friends. Painful things
occurred in our households. I never found my
little Lizzie, who left me after the surrender of
Petersburg. One day I surprised my husband's
gentle mother in tears, because of the condition of a
small servant who had returned to her after wandering
through the country, and who was now smitten
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_415' name='Page_415' href='#Page_415'>415</a></span>
with fever. My sister had reared a superb young
woman, Clara, whom we all loved and respected.
She too disappeared, to be mourned by the entire
family. Six months after she left, my brother was
aroused late at night by a violent ringing at the
door. His wife entreated him not to open the
door, for these sudden alarms were to be dreaded;
but he said, "I mustâ€”I cannot help thinking
Clara may return." When the door was opened in
the midnight darkness, a small trunk was hastily
thrust in by an unseen hand, and Clara fell across
the threshold. She never spoke again! Next day
she died, and in her slender stock of clothing there
was no word, no clew, to solve the mystery of her
death.

<p>
As early as 1865 Congress directed that an
amendment to the Constitution should be submitted
to all the states, prescribing that "neither slavery
nor involuntary servitude" should thenceforth exist
in the United States. I don't know how this
amendment was received by other states. Virginia
adopted it at once, and the new-made citizen took
his place there as a constituent part of the American
people. "Every barrier between the races was
levelled to the ground as far as the action of the
Federal government could effect it. The Africans
were now the political equals of all other Americans.
They were competent to vote, to preside on the
bench, to command in the army, to represent
the country at foreign courts, to sit in the Senate,
and to officiate as governors of states, and as Presidents
of the United States. It is not surprising
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_416' name='Page_416' href='#Page_416'>416</a></span>
that President Lincoln, walking through the streets
of Richmond after the surrender, should have gazed
with 'a pathetic wonder' on the African crowd
around him. By his act they had become citizens,
and it is possible that he wondered at the probable
result."<a name='FA_27' id='FA_27' href='#FN_27' class='fnanchor'>[27]</a>
</p>

<p>
Far different has been the treatment, by this
country, of our only original native Americansâ€”the
North American Indians!
</p>

<p>
The story of "reconstruction," and of the pangs
and throes through which Virginia worked out her
salvation, has been told by an abler pen than mine.
Nor can I follow further the fortunes of our own
family, of our struggle for existence in a new home,
of our final reward. This will be a story for another
book. Eighteen months after my husband left me
I had the following letter from him:â€”
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Don't imagine I have the least idea of abandoning my
experiment here. I mean 'to fight it out on this line,'
to the end of the struggle. My practice increases slowly,
but is based, I believe, on a conviction of my competency.
Thank God, what I have accomplished, though small, has
been achieved by my own unaided exertions and without
the least obligation to a human being. I have no patron.
I have never solicited business. My only arts are study
and devotion to duty. These expedients may be slow of
operation but they are sure, and they leave my dignity and
self-respect uncompromised. I am not conscious of having
received a favor since my residence in New York: and
when the victory is achieved, I shall have inexpressible
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_417' name='Page_417' href='#Page_417'>417</a></span>
satisfaction in saying, with Coriolanusâ€”'<i>alone</i> I did it!'
When I speak of 'favors,' I mean in the way of my
profession. Of some personal kindness I have been the
grateful recipient,â€”though not in many instances."
</p>
</div> <!-- /blockquot -->

<p>
Within two years I followed him with our children;
and if I cannot say with Mr. Burke, "my
adopted and my <i>dearer</i>" home, yet so warm and
abounding was the welcome accorded us that we
are attached to it by the strongest ties of gratitude
and affection.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The last time I visited Petersburg I drove out to
her battle-fields. Nature had hidden the scars with
beauty. The seeds of the daisy had been scattered
wherever the Federal forces had been encamped, and
they had whitened the fields and covered the graves
by the wayside. Nature had not forgotten these
lonely unmarked graves, nor will she ever forget,
until time shall be no more.
</p>

<p>
It is not easy to write about the dreadful war between
the North and the South. We press our
breasts against a thorn when we recall the anguish
of those days of death and disaster. It is often said
that it is still too early to write the story of our Civil
War. It will soon be too late. Some of us still
live who saw those days. We should not shrink
from recording what we know to be true. Thus
only will a full history of American courage and
fidelity be preserved,â€”for all were Americans.
The glory of one is the glory of allâ€”in 1861 when
brothers were in conflict, as well as in 1898 when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_418' name='Page_418' href='#Page_418'>418</a></span>
they stood shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart
against a foreign foe. Circumstances do not rule the
heart, and "where the heart is right, there is true
patriotism."

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
